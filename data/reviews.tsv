TITLE: Holiday Tea at The Adolphus | TEXT: Carlos, Jitendra, and their entire team provided our group of 14 with an amazing Holiday High Tea experience  The treats were delicious, and Carlos’s commentary added to the overall atmosphere—an absolutely perfect afternoon.	0
TITLE: Consistent excellence | TEXT: This was our third visit to this always busy restaurant. The food was again excellent. Our wait person was excellent and provided valuable advice. Every dish was special and will return again soon!	0
TITLE: Stockton's finest | TEXT: I recently visited Stockton visiting  family and friends after being away for 10 years a must have is Arroyos  restaurant. I have been a loyal customer since the 70's and have followed them when they relocated. Yes the food is that good,the homemade  tortillas fresh salsa available in medium and hot. This food is made with love of three generations. I recommend  the combination plate with the beef taco,chili relleno and beef enchilada,the gravy is good enough to jump through a plate glass window without breaking it. Over the years I have tried every dish at least twice and have  come to this choice.If your in a rush try the beef,bean and cheese burrito filling and fast made with love.I have been to thousands of restaurants all over the world tried cuisine in Mexico and Arroyos is 5 star in satisfaction and taste bud joy	1
TITLE: Exceptional all around | TEXT: We went to visit our kids. Saison experience was beyond expectations. Staff game us exceptional service. Food and drinks were well presented and delicious.	0
TITLE: Busy, delicious to-go options in the heart of downtown Philly | TEXT: Crowded and bustling, between the tight fits amid the narrow aisles, you can find some amazing greasy-spoon lunch options frequented by tourists and locals alike.  There are several great options for cheesesteak and various Asian fare.  Best to get anything to-go, though, because tables are hard to come by and packed in tightly together where they do exist.	1
TITLE: Calming and amazing! | TEXT: I got the black & white cookie for dessert and it was great! The quality of their service was amazing because they gave out dishes to your table. The interior was also very calming and dim (but not pitch black) and vintage-like. They had a variety of many foods for different times (breakfast, brunch, lunch, dinner, dessert, and drinks). I suggest you go here with your friends for a nice chat or small meal!	1
TITLE: Love it here! | TEXT: My sister and I started going to this venue at the beginning of 2025 and have since become regulars.  The food is fantastic, the staff are incredibly kind and welcoming (from the front door to the wait staff) and the entertainment is over the top. The jazz artists they manage to get are the best!   I cannot wait to see what 2026 brings to this fantastic venue.  And a shout out to the emcee Mr. Kenny - he is a very cool person.	0
TITLE: Best restorant in Miami | TEXT: I have to write another review for Sexy fish. The only restaurant in Miami that has a smoking section with gold ashtrays. Rating 100/10. The dessert was perfect	0
TITLE: Excellent | TEXT: Came here for dinner with my Philly family - food was excellent  - very nicely prepared & presented!  Great service - would highly recommend to anyone visiting Philadelphia.	0
TITLE: If the locals are always here, it’s got to be good. And it was great! | TEXT: Rustic environment with excellent food and lots of options. We’ve driven by multiple times on our way to Jacksonville and were determined to stop this time. We got there around 11:45am, hoping to beat the rush, which we did. By the time we left, both the parking lot and restaurant were full. It was very obvious that the vast majority of the folks inside were locals. My wife had fried shrimp - about a dozen large shrimp with a very light coating of batter. Excellent! I wanted something not fried and opted for the full pot of the chowder. Also excellent! They say it’s made fresh daily, and it was. A medium sized pan filled with a tomato based, thick soup with fresh potatoes, celery and large chunks of tuna and diced shrimp. Highly recommend. Also available in a “half pot” if you’re not really hungry. Don’t drive by - go in and enjoy great food and service.	1
TITLE: Birthday luncheon | TEXT: With an old coworker was a wonderful time because the food here is so delicious & the atmosphere lively. We want to thank Jordan M who was truly lovely & made our time even more joyful,	0
"TITLE: We love this place!! We travel miles to get to OUR FAVORITE ITALIAN RESTAURANT. | TEXT: Bestie came and we introduced them to our favorite Italian place. We also go every year for his birthday.  We tried: The goat cheese ball appetizer- Excellent sauce with the bread to dip with.🤌 The food truck favorite- good flavor ❤️ pesto. The limoncello ""smooth & creamy""🤤. The orange cake tastes like a grandma made it with love & the pecans were lighty toasted/ crunchy & the carmel was smooth & sweet like honey OMG! The owner suggested the chocolate mousse. WOW!! 🙃 I instantly turned into the Kool-aid man ""OH YEAH"" it was so good. We all give it 5 stars.🤩😍"	1
TITLE: Avoid…don’t be thrown by Michelin star! | TEXT: Drinks took 20 minutes to get and they arrived only because we had to remind them we ordered them. Food was simply awful. The leek dish did not taste like leeks at all. Not sure what was inside the tortilla. The presentation is ugly. We ordered four dishes and left after two…90 minutes later…yes service was that bad! Skip this restaurant and go to Kokos down the street!	1
TITLE: Thankful for Panda for opening up for us during the Coronavirus outbreak | TEXT: After trying hard to find Chinese restaurants that will allow patrons to dine inside I was lucky to find Panda open and being careful to keep diners social distanced while serving a well stocked buffet of fresh tasty food.  This seems to be the least critical review of all written about Panda although most found the food good.  Sure the place doesn't look as fancy as others but it also isn't pretentious as some buffets and if it keeps costs down, I have absolutely no complaints and everyone agrees it is well worth the price.  I'm not foolish enough to think I can have it both ways, fancy decorations and extras with the lowest prices, especially because it was a clean place, the waiter brought our drinks three times, was courteous, wore a mask as all the staff and I felt safe and taken care of.  The watermelon was sweet and juicy, ice cream was the real kind, not soft serve and I enjoyed and finished every dish I took.  They were cooked and seasoned perfectly.  The vegetable dishes were fresh and crispy, never overcooked to a mush like some southern vegetables tend to be.  None of the food was old or lacked freshness.  It was all well done and very tasteful to me and my companion who was glad I found a place so nice, compared to another  that was not open for dining in.	1
TITLE: Thank you! | TEXT: This was just the loveliest freakin' experience. I brought my wife here for a (belated, because it takes awhile to get a reservation!🤣) birthday dinner, just the other night. I've rarely experienced such a warm, welcoming and pleasant atmosphere. It really was just like a dinner party. Every single person in this place seemed to be having a blast. The food was wonderful, of course (when I die, let it be by drowning in a pool of white truffle sabayon). What really made the difference though? The complete lack of pretension or stuffiness. This place is run and operated by a group of folks who clearly love the heck out of what they do. You can tell they're like a family. I simply had a wonderful time. That's it! I would happily go back and cannot wait for the opportunity. I am a father of two. I do not get nights out. I do not have a life. Not really. I am very thankful for the staff at the Kitchen for giving us another lovely memory and another dining experience to look forward to repeating. Thank you!	0
TITLE: Overhyped and overpriced | TEXT: Very average food. Much of the seafood plater was over salted or mushy. The other small plates we had (fried oysters, crab capellini and ground shrimp with noodles) were either bland or over spiced. I tried to order a bottle of white wine (the list is very overpriced) and the first bottle ended up being a red that was listed on the white menu and the second couldn’t be located. Service was good but the food was poor and well below New Orleans seafood standards.	1
TITLE: Perfect Asian fusion experience | TEXT: Benu is an over the top Asian fusion restaurant in downtown San Francisco.  The meal is a prix fixe experience with 3-4 pre—meal appetizers.   Then the menu is superb, it includes pheasant, lobster, quail and abalone.   Dessert is a yuja sorbet with chocolate swirls.  The service is the best ever - everything was done perfectly and every dish was explained perfectly.  A good wonderful dinner and experience.	0
TITLE: Great experience | TEXT: It was a great experience I went there with my family and we love it. It was amazing hospitality and super fresh food. Highly recommended	0
TITLE: Excellent | TEXT: Excellent In-N-Out Burger. Reasonably fast and very friendly service. I see no point in the Drive-Thru. Cars were lined up on to the main road. I walked in, ordered, and was served within 6 minutes.	1
TITLE: Decadent Italian small dishes | TEXT: The menu is full of very well prepared Italian plates for sharing.   Dishes were a hit and served hot out of the kitchen - the polpette meatballs were savory and flavorful, and we loved the polenta, squash, clams, gnocchi, bucatini and balanzoni.   Perhaps the rigatoni was the only unimpressive dish we would pass on next time.   The tiramisu is decadent and enough to share across 4-6 people!   Tart cherry sorbetto was a serious treat!!   Our server was welcoming and attentive, very familiar with the menu and recommended an excellent wine.  They do tack on 3% kitchen admin - not to say the kitchen was any less than superb, but we are beyond unusual circumstances of Covid.   Consumers prefer simplicity and transparency and it would come off well to price the menu as you need to.	1
TITLE: Affordable Latin fusion | TEXT: Great place for a Latin fusion cuisine. Ceviches are to die for! Cuban empanadas are delicious 😋 drinks great and Albert the host manager a GEM !	0
TITLE: Fantastic brunch spot | TEXT: This was probably our favourite meal in San Francisco… great range of brunch options and fantastic friendly service- highly recommend	0
TITLE: BEST MEAL SO FAR! | TEXT: My wife and I have been visiting TURUNC for many years,if fact we stayed at the Es for a month 10 yrs ago,but we have not visited the restaurant for a few years,we went tonight,to be met by Mehmet,who was there 10 yrs ago, We booked a table the night before,tonight we a free starter of homemade bread and an olive oil dip,followed by chicken in bacon sauce and chicken with salmon & almond,both meals were excellent as was the service and great views and good value for money,we both said the best meal of our month long stay,we will be back	0
TITLE: Outstanding Place for Breakfast/Brunch | TEXT: The Dutch has changed a bit since some of these pictures.  It has upgraded the atmosphere, and the food continues to be outstanding. The wait staff is fast, friendly and efficient.  We had a egg white omelet and 3-Egg breakfast.  I recommend the sausage; its some of the best I've have had in a while (but spicy).   Great local place, quiet and good for talking.	1
TITLE: What a dinner… | TEXT: Excellent food, drink, ambience and service. Couple that with an old school vibe and an amazing view, and it makes for a great dinner.  We loved it and would return.	0
TITLE: Wet Behind the Bear's Ears | TEXT: Week long educational outing with a small group that was really educational and fun.  Seeing Bear's Ears National Monument for the first time was breathtaking.  The depth of knowledge from the scholars and coordinators on the excursion was very helpful.  Our native cultures are still alive and well and we all should explore while we have the opportunity.  Crow Canyon respects our Native American lands and wants to preserve and share with everyone.	0
TITLE: A love letter to Kann | TEXT: This place was an EXPERIENCE to say the least.  Let’s start with the service our server made our experience very unique to us, understanding my personal dietary restrictions and explaining the restaurant and it’s entirety to us and the culture how the food works and is intended to be eaten (that being shared of personal meals).   Now let’s talk about the food. The food itself felt like comfort all while still remaining sophisticated. It was extremely well portioned for you to be able to experience from starter meals to the actual entrées all the way to dessert. The best way to describe the food experience I had was the comfort of going to eat at my Nina’s and being served my favorite meal but at an elevated experience with great drinks and service.   One thing I normally don’t review is atmosphere because I love hole in the walls, but the atmosphere of the restaurant itself was organized without feeling so modern and also very busy while also feeling very warm and that says quite a bit, considering that we sat at the communal counter, which you would imagine would feel like like a very individualized experience, yet, it was! I felt as though I was in my own bubble and loved seeing what others were ordering (I’m nosey like that). So don’t shy away from the chef’s counter if you can’t get your own table. Oh and cleanliness was a 11/10.   The price point was fair.   I would 10000% recommend this as not only a restaurant but as an experience.	1
TITLE: Above | TEXT: Another amazing experience today. Had tofu tacos and a latte. View of the bay from my seat only a few yards from the west shore of Treasure Island. And as always the staff was so friendly and helpful to this senior.	0
TITLE: Great birthday surprise | TEXT: I booked a surprise birthday gift for my husband to 'fly' a simulator Spitfire. It was amazing. My husband was thrilled with this experience as his late mother built these planes during the war. Lovely welcoming staff who helped make this a remarkable memory.	0
TITLE: Absolutely loved this iconic place | TEXT: If you like Jazz this is an essential bar to visit.  The decor is amazing dating from 1934 and the jazz music was incredible. The drink prices were excellent too.  Very good cocktails for just $8.  Also really liked the bar staff.  This is definitely worth a visit	0
TITLE: Exceptional Experience | TEXT: This was my third or fourth time dining at Friday Saturday Sunday, and I think it gets better each time! The detail to every aspect of the food preparation is evident, along with the variety and uniqueness of every dish.  The servers are very approachable and extremely knowledgeable about every dish. The meal starts with seasonal snacks and progresses through vegetable tastings and a variety of proteins.  The meal ends with a dessert or two that in a perfect ending to a magnificent culinary experience!  I visit Philadelphia solo and never feel awkward or out of place dining by myself at this restaurant.  This is definitely a very upscale restaurant but pulls that off without being pretentious or snobby.  The upstairs tasting menu dining room is cozy yet comfortable.  I really can't say enough about the restaurant!  It is expensive, but should be thought of as an experience more than just a dinner.  In my opinion, the quality justifies the experience.  An added bonus to the tasting menu is the great wine and cocktail selections.  Friday Saturday Sunday really cares about it's patrons.  I look forward to seeing the hostess when I walk in, as she remembers me from previous visits.  That's pretty amazing considering the number of people that walk through that door.	0
TITLE: Bring your appetite | TEXT: Stopped for lunch and was stuffed for the rest of the day! Huge portions, good food, friendly staff. The chicken enchilada soup was my favorite.	0
TITLE: Not the old Ola | TEXT: Used to really enjoy but just had a very disappointing lunch.  The ceviche was far too acidic, overpowering the fish, and the shrimp overcooked and tough.  Fortunately the mojitos were very good	1
"TITLE: [no title] | TEXT: Favorite breakfast and short order place.  Food,  service and price is great!  Best of all is the friendly ""hometown"" atmosphere."	0
TITLE: Order to go??? | TEXT: Love the food - never missed yet on the three times that I have been there.  The only problem is the lack of sufficient parking. Most of the street parking require resident stickers or are limited to 15 minutes or 1 hour at the most.  Parking lots holds 8  (?) cars? Go with someone with a resident parking sticker.	1
TITLE: It was walking into a ToysRus store | TEXT: I had read many reviews online and asked staff at my hotel all the food market. It was a 10-15 walk from my hotel and walking to the Reading Terminal Market was like walking into a toy store and not knowing what toy you want buy first.  There was so much  choices  of food available.  After walking round the market for around 10 minutes looking to see what I fancied I eventually chose a vender and had my first Philly cheesesteak.  Delicious, will defo go back again before I leave. Must do place for a visit.	0
TITLE: Harding Presidential Sites | TEXT: We had a great visit to the Warren G Harding Presidential Library and Memorial. The Library (aka Museum) is quite small compared to other presidential libraries, but does a good job telling the story of Harding's short presidency. Tours of his home are only offered on the hour, so we had to miss that, but did take photos from the outside. We also visited the Harding Memorial in the cemetery, which was quite impressive. If you're passing by Marion, Ohio, take a break from your drive and stop by to see the presidential sites.	0
TITLE: Good but garlic everywhere | TEXT: The food and the service are good. But so much garlic everywhere…drinks were also good. I would go back but not my first choice.	1
TITLE: Great drinks by Sabina | TEXT: This place is always fun to come back to. I enjoy my time at the bar usually and servie by Sabina is great! She is a very lovely lady and always good to talk to.	0
TITLE: Clap and bow at every bite | TEXT: This is an experience in dining like no other! I have dined here 4 times since 2008. We always had unique savory food in small bites coupled with an entertaining chef. Cuisine masterpieces are presented like a show. Bravo! Standing ovation!	0
TITLE: Flavor party in every bite | TEXT: One of the best restaurants ever! If you enjoy flavor and creativity and great service, this place hits all the marks! The chefs choice tasting menu was fantastic!	0
TITLE: Great food, great staff and a different experience! | TEXT: There were 4 of us and one person could not tolerate garlic and our server really helped to determine the dishes that were free of it and which ones could be modified. I knew we were in a great restaurant ! Lots in the menu to choose from and the concept was to share the plates. We decided to do that but we also chose to have one as our main dish each. All the dishes were fantastic and too many to individually comment on. My main was the black cod and it was very good. I also had a bite of the pork chop and it was rich in flavour, moist and actually heavenly.  Overall a great culinary outing ! Well done!	1
TITLE: A welcome surprise | TEXT: When we got to San Quirico and saw the town, the main square, and the outside of the hotel, we were prepared to be disappointed. It's a small town, there's a gas station in the center of the piazza, and if you're looking for the hotel - well, the sign mostly indicates the restaurant: Ristorante La Vecchia Fonte. In fact, you have to enter the restaurant, walk through to the back, and say you have a reservation in the hotel. The friendly and helpful (though somewhat English-challenged) staff take you upstairs and show you your room - the rooms are bright, clean, and usable, with views overlooking the piazza or the town. It's a 15 minute (or so) level walk to the historic abandoned town of Vertozza nearby; otherwise, there's not much to do in San Quirico. We had dinner in the hotel's restaurant (Very good!) and breakfast (included) in the back of the restaurant. The promised WiFi didn't seem to connect in our room - but this is often the case in Italian hotels in our experience.	1
TITLE: Nice treat | TEXT: I first visited Tail Up Goat in 2019. It was astounding. Tried to visit last year but without a reservation, and ended up at their excellent sister restaurant. This year, we made reservations.  Great meal. The format has changed in the years since my first visit. Now, if you dine in the dining room, you must order the complete pre fixe menu… and some of the food is raw. I didn’t love that. But overall a delicious meal, nicely paced.	0
TITLE: A wonderful winery and restaurant! | TEXT: A wonderful winery with a great restaurant. Very beautiful inside. Friendly staff. Great to go up the stairs and look down from above into the giant barrel rooms! A very special place.	0
TITLE: Museum and House Tour Make this a fun Visit | TEXT: A visit to this presidential library comprises three potential activities.  First, there is an hour long tour of his house.  Second, the main building includes a small exhibition of his time as President.  Lastly, a mile from the library is his memorial.  We spent just under two hours here.	0
TITLE: Dont come | TEXT: We had a reservation but sat over 40 minutes after, ran out of our menu choice then ran out of the beer we ordered and food took forever to come.  Will not come back	1
TITLE: Learning at the Warren G. Harding Presidential Sites | TEXT: Great trip. We arrived at approximately 9:30 am and made our way towards the entrance of the museum. After paying the admission fee, we received a quick overview of the site and went on our way. We opted to view some of the outdoor exhibits first, which included the guard house and press house. The press house contained multiple informational plaques about President Hardings wife and her contributions to society. After viewing the press house, we made our way to the front porch of the house, where we waited for the 10 am guided hour tour to begin. There were guided tours of the presidents former house being held every hour throughout the day. The guided tour of the house was very informational, and the tour guide took us from room to room, while pointing out interesting features and artifacts out for display. The tour guide told us several personal stories related to the Hardings time at the house. The guided tour lasted roughly 1 hour.  After viewing the house, we went back inside to view the main exhibits. We opted to watch a short documentary about President Hardings life and some of the trials and tribulations he faced during his time as President. There were multiple informational plaques out for display, many of them quite text heavy, that went into detail about Hardings upbringing and roots as the owner of a newspaper company in Marion. The plaques also talked about election day, and several of the policy’s Harding implemented while in office. The last section of the museum dealt with his death and some controversial issues that surrounded his presidency. There were multiple artifacts out for display in the museum, along with short video clips that related to President Harding's time in office.  Tip: I recommend spending 3 hours here if you truly want to see everything.	0
TITLE: A well drilled operation and good food. And inexpensive | TEXT: Although not particularly a fan of burgers we gave this place a try. The visit was made better as we managed to get a table. With the volume of customers that isn't guaranteed. The quantity and quality of food was very good. Watching the throughput of customers and speed of operation [very slick] was impressive. And obviously very popular as one early evening we saw the queue [line] from order counter to door and some yards down the street.	1
TITLE: Nothing left to see | TEXT: Church of Saint Menas of Samatya also called as Agios Minas Church in Turkish is a Greek Orthodox Church in İstanbul.İt is located in the district of Fatih,in the neighbourhood of Kocamustafapaşa (historical Samatya) and it lies inside the walled city.Very easy to reach at by public transport like buses and tram and then a short walk.Presently it is also difficult to locate it and not in a good shape to see.Not recommended.	1
TITLE: A bit of a disappointment | TEXT: Having been recommended this as a treat for brunch we were looking forward to our visit.  Aware that most hotel lifts need a card to make them work we asked at the front desk and they just told us to go up to the 19th floor.  We went up as far as the 14th where a customer got in the lift and we started to descend again.  Luckily this customer used their room key to press for the 19th and once everyone got out in the lobby we went back up again.   The young lady serving was very polite and friendly but was on her own and the two people who were behind the desk did not attempt to help her.   We ordered starters and a main and after a half hour wait all the food came out together.  The main was warm but not hot as was the starter the toast had been hot at some point but was definitely cold by the time it got to us.   Having said all that the restaurant looked stunning, the food when it finally arrived although a little cold tasted good and the price was not unreasonable it’s just a shame that the customer experience was not what we would have expected	1
TITLE: Left Feeling Unwelcome Despite the Good Food | TEXT: Here’s a polished version that includes your new points and flows naturally in the review:  ---  Visited this restaurant with my husband for date night, but unfortunately our experience was disappointing. Right at the start, the waitress made a rude comment about my husband ordering tap water, which already set the wrong tone.  After ordering our drinks, we were told to grab salad from the salad bar. I wasn’t even halfway through my salad when, within about six minutes, they brought around six different types of meat. Everything felt extremely rushed, to the point where I had to turn my ticket to “no” because it was all coming too fast. I’ve been to Brazil, and even there the service is never this hurried.  My husband didn’t take any salad, so he was only eating meat. After about 45 minutes, they took away our plates, making it clear we wouldn’t receive any more food. The food and drinks themselves were actually good, and if we hadn’t felt rushed and unwelcome, we would’ve gladly ordered more drinks and even dessert.  They say they want to give you an “experience,” but unfortunately this was not a good one.	1
TITLE: Cold food | TEXT: I must give up coming to this location!  They take the order so far from the pay window, approx 40+ cars in line.  By the time I get my hamburger it is COLD!  I have mentioned to order takers, no response from them.  If only, they would take orders when maybe 10 cars ahead! I give up!	1
TITLE: My favorite wings | TEXT: We’ve never eaten in the restaurant , normally we get our food to go. We were seated quickly and there seemed to be plenty of help. They took our drink order and then our order. Our food came out reasonably quick considering how busy they were. We were there Saturday early evening, all college football on all the screens. All in all I would definitely come back again. If there’s a drawback for me is how noisy it is, but I anticipated this and I’m not dinging the place for this.	1
TITLE: Average stay | TEXT: Stayed here in 2005. Check in was ok. Room was ok with a kitchenette. Some cultery within the drawers needed clean, we didn't use them, Bought plastic forks from local shop. The pool area is lovely, although very busy in the evenings, i think they allow locals to use the pool, hard to find an empty sun lounger. The hotel is pretty much located next to the beach, which was nice if you wanted a change from the noise of the pool area. We didn't eat at the hotel, either ate out or made our own food in room.   Manta Rota is a very very quiet area in the algarve. Manta Rota is also a very small, quiet area. Not much to do. We spent most of our time further up the road in Monte Gordio, it's more liver with better selection of restaurants to choose from. Manta Rota is fine if your looking to sit and read a book all week. It was not the place that was sold to us, we were in mid tewnties, averge age was about 60 years!	1
"TITLE: A ""Must See"" Museum! | TEXT: The National Museum of Wildlife Art is located about 10 mins. outside of Jackson Spectacular monumental bronze sculptures are located thru out the museums outdoor campus, not to mention incredible views of the valley. Inside, a fabulous collections of paintings & sculptures  from the 1800's - present day and a really good Cafe' for lunch, snacks or just a few moments to sit. This museum's not to be missed."	0
TITLE: Burger, Shakes and the Delta. | TEXT: I think everyone in Stockton has to know that if you are coming back from a long day on the Water, you gotta refuel and finish off your Day over at Bob's Marina. You can get a massive burger for a pretty decent price as well as a pretty nice shake (best flavor is chocolate). Idk what else to say, this place is iconic for any Delta goer. Make sure you are hungry before heading over.	0
TITLE: ANOTHER GREAT MEAL | TEXT: Another year,another visit,my wife and I and two friends,visited tonight,we were shown to our pre booked table by Mehmet,we had a great view of the harbour and village,we had free homemade bread and a dip to start,followed by chicken in bacon sauce and chicken & salmon in almond sauce,which is exactly what we had last year,and as last year,both were excellent as was the service. Maybe the best meal so far!	0
TITLE: This is not good food | TEXT: The quality and taste of the food on the buffet is sub-par.  This probably explains why the place is virtually empty even at prime dining hours.	0
TITLE: Excellent food and Service | TEXT: Friends found this gem.   They raved about the food and service.   We went back with them the next day.   I ordered a BLT  and Hubs  ordered a chicken wrap both were excellent.  My BLT was actually  a stack of crispy bacon on toast with lettuce and tomato.    Not the usual lettuce and tomato bed with 2 strips of bacon.   Best BLT I’ve ever had offered for $7.   Or $ 10 with a side    Cheesecake for desert   Owner makes all the food  from scratch.  The cheesecake was heavenly.  The texture was a cross of cheese cake and mousse.veer light and creamy.  The owner came out and greeted us.    Will definitely return.	1
TITLE: Beautiful Elegant Yet Fun Ambiance | TEXT: I had dinner here tonight and give this place 5 stars due to the attentiveness and ambience. The decor, including a huge fish tank with a submarine inside catches your eye right away. Steak was amazing, and the staff gave me a surprise dessert when I told them I was celebrating a milestone accomplishment with work. They also promptly called me just as I was leaving the parking lot to inform me of an item left behind (at first I wondered how they even knew my number but figure they got it off of OpenDoor). Highly recommend this place and would definitely visit again.	1
TITLE: Funny quotes great service | TEXT: This is a quirky restaurant with funny quotes.  You will want to look up the quotes online.   We went for a weekend lunch and got a table quickly.   The service is prompt and the chips and salsa was good with the a nice heat to the salsa.   We ordered a couple dishes.  One of the dishes was switched with another diner so it had bacon in it.  The wait staff recognized on their own that they had made an error and apologized profusely and offered to it right by bringing out the dish made without the bacon.  It is rare to have that caring and hospitality any more in casual dining.   I was super impressed and would recommend this restaurant without hesitation.  The food itself was very good.  And, yes their quotes on the walls and boards are funny.	1

TITLE: Great place for a party | TEXT: We had the whole restaurant to ourselves for a birthday lunch. All of my guests raved about the food and the service. I had left the food selection up to Louis, the owner, and he chose well - seafood peleau, pork loin tender enough to cut with a fork, and coq au vin, also tender and delicious. The food was plentiful, and also included salad and dessert. Lunch was served hot and on schedule. We brought our own wine and paid a small corkage fee. Louis was great to work with during the planning stage, and always replied quickly to my phone calls, texts and emails. Wonderful experience all around and we will be back. Oh, and the location is very cool, too. You almost feel like you are really in the Caribbean.	1
TITLE: Cajun authentic experience | TEXT: Great place for lunch, probably for dinner too, also very central, besides the famous French Quarter. One of my good memories from New Orleans.	0
TITLE: Very nice coffee | TEXT: The best coffee in the city, keep going.. beautiful furniture, nice view. Espresso was quite good, the staff were polite ..	0
TITLE: Embarrassing Customer Service | TEXT: At about 1:30 this afternoon I visited the store on March Lane with my wife and got a cup of coffee I sat in the lobby for one hour drinking the coffee and I decided to get a refill I went to the register and asked the lady at the register whose name I don’t know to give me a refill but to my surprise she told me that I was not sitting in the lobby so she told me she couldn’t give me one I told her a couple of times that I was sitting in the lobby but still she didn’t believe me she went in and asked a colleague in the back room and the colleague confirmed that I came earlier and I was sitting in the lobby That was very embarrassing A manager came and apologised about what happen I felt so embarrassed that I used to visit that store everyday but not anymore My name is Jihad Basma and my phone number number is 2093199098	1

TITLE: Wonderful dining experience | TEXT: Great experience from ambience to service and food. Visited with friends and loved all of our selections: Tuna Cannoli, Halibut, Steak, and Bone Marrow. Our drinks were mixed perfectly and table service was impeccable.	0
TITLE: Delicious brunch & friendly vibes! | TEXT: Everything was delicious, fresh, and exquisitely presented, and I had the best breakfast here. From the minute we arrived, the personnel made us feel very welcome and very nice. Beautiful interior decor, ideal for unwinding before a full day of city exploration. I'm eager to return and would highly recommend!	0
TITLE: Phenomenal flavors! | TEXT: Phenomenal flavors! My husband and I always enjoy experiencing different restaurants when we travel and this was our favorite food of the trip by far. Flavors were complex & interesting while remaining balanced - I had so much fun tasting every bite of the meal. Highly recommend!	0
TITLE: Clam chowder not what you'd expect | TEXT: Clam chowder was a red based chowder kind of a hot spicy stew. Not what we expected clam chowder to be  Food was good but expensive and small. Also service was slow.  Waitress was distracted just a few waitresses for a crowd. It's not a very big place. Probably only a dozen tables if you don't eat outside.   Try the palm fish camp about a mile away. It's excellent.	1
TITLE: Fantastic Restaurant for Dine-In or Catering | TEXT: We hired Verdes Restaurant for catering at our recent event and were absolutely blown away! The food was fresh, flavorful, and beautifully presented — every guest raved about it. The service was just as impressive: professional, organized, and so easy to work with. They made the entire experience stress-free and elevated our event in every way. If you're looking for top-tier catering with unforgettable food and seamless service, Verdes is the way to go! Highly recommended.	0
TITLE: Great food and service! | TEXT: Good food and service.  We visited during the non peak time between lunch & dinner which can sometimes not be a good thing but the service was spot on and food was delicious.  My husband and I both had the Fajita burrito.  I even asked for some alterations to mine. Perfect!	1
TITLE: Great service with a lovely view | TEXT: ES is a very friendly restaurant with great service, delicious food and a lovely view of the harbour in Turunc. There is a nice selection of local and western dishes to choose from and the steaks are very good. Highly recommended.	0
TITLE: Good stuff | TEXT: Best curry in the country , authentic, homemade curry. Absolutely the most friendly staff you can meet. Worth it’s weight in gold this place	0
TITLE: The worst anniversary in history | TEXT: We arrived on time, perhaps slightly early for our reservation and were aggressively and very inhospitably treated by the 3 Three hostesses that were clearly not busy and more importantly not at all interested in us having a wonderful anniversary.  We waited over an hour at the bar and lounge and were given NO attention or updates whatsoever.  I have never been treated in such an inhumane fashion, the very worst I have ever undergone in my 35 years of dining at Miami's hottest/trendiest establishments.  Such a sad, sad, very sad end to what should have been a wonderful evening.	1
TITLE: A good afternoon’s bottle of wine!! | TEXT: We spent a good afternoon drinking a bottle of house white wine in Stockton’s only Mexican restaurant and bar in central California in America on our drive from Los Angeles to San Francisco. A good bottle of wine, ok atmosphere and cleanish lavatories.	0
TITLE: Huge disappointment | TEXT: Went here with dogs.  Sat at outdoor patio service was fine but food not.  One of the recommended dishes was biscuits and gravy.  Did not finish and return to kitchen.  Got chicken and waffles.  Not much of improvement.  Wife got Benedict and not good at all.  Don't understand how this place is at top hotel and subpar food.  But I see many reviews below average	0
TITLE: Rooftop nights | TEXT: My first time here, i was invited at the rooftop for the Motown nights every Thursday. Very good, decent and behaved crowds.  Opens 7-10.  Definitely for someone who is a Motown music fan.  We danced the night away.  Drinks are priced reasonably.  One big bonus is the very, very nice sunset view.  Gets really really busy by 8:30. This placed has started putting Stockton on the map again.  Downtown has been so sleepy in the past few years.  I hope this will go on and on. Four stars for I saw some little kids in this very adult venue.	1
TITLE: You just need to go! | TEXT: When I tell you that the food in this place, and the service, are top-tier and impeccable, I state that with no exaggeration. You have got to go to this restaurant! The standouts for me were definitely the rabbit and the apricot and raspberry tart topped with lemongrass ice cream. Words cannot express the delectable meal you will experience!	0
TITLE: Hospitality and seafood excellence | TEXT: For a special occasion dinner, this restaurant and staff exceeded my expectations. We went mid week, counter seating. Staff attentive and provided nice little extras like a hook for my handbag, a lobby coat rack, warm, wet hand towels. Chef owner Hiro himself cooked and served. We indulged in a paired sake tasting with the meal and it was educational and tasty. The food was excellent, seafood melt in your mouth, and quite varied for late winter, some sourced from Japan. Hiro provided context for each course, how it related to the overall theme of the meal. The atmosphere was easygoing, organized, courses timed nicely, I could not have asked for a better dining experience.	1
TITLE: Blessing in disguise! | TEXT: My husband called and made a reservation at Bella Vista to celebrate my birthday.  When we arrived at the restaurant, it was closed for a private party!!!  Seems to me the restaurant needs to do better training.  Needless to say, we were not really excited to eat there after reading Yelp reviews online.	1
TITLE: Avoid this place | TEXT: I visited Nusr-Et in Istanbul and had an excellent experience, so I was expecting something similar from this branch — but it fell far short. The service was very poor, and the meal was wildly overpriced.  The staff lacked professionalism and attention, which made the entire experience disappointing. Management should seriously address the service quality.  Overall, I felt scammed. Not recommended at all. Avoid this place.	0
TITLE: Brunch by the Park... | TEXT: TY, TY, TY!!!!!  For being awesome, being opened and being SO TASTY!!!!!  Hubby and I had some business Downtown and we were looking for an awesome brunch spot!!!  OH MY GOODNESS, the Bergen Benedict and Creme Brule  French Toast were FABULOUS with lattes!!!  Simply the TASTIEST!!!!! <3	0
TITLE: Awesome front desk | TEXT: The staff at front desk is outstanding. Especially Tatiana, and her associate. They adjusted our 3rd party booking like true professionals.	1
TITLE: Great Food; Extremely Hot!! | TEXT: I love Jamaican food and so we went to their new location in Stockton on Pershing.  The Jerk Chicken was so good but unfortunately it was also unbearably hot.  I know Scotch Bonnet peppers will take your head off and I wish they could make a more moderate version of Jerk Chicken without so much heat.  I really want to eat this dish but neither I nor my husband can stand how hot it was.  My husband is a real champion when it comes to eating hot food; he's not wimpy like me.  He says he can't eat that dish again either.  I hope the owner will read this review.	1
TITLE: Great service with a lovely view | TEXT: ES is a very friendly restaurant with great service, delicious food and a lovely view of the harbour in Turunc. There is a nice selection of local and western dishes to choose from and the steaks are very good. Highly recommended.	0
TITLE: Deserving 3 Michelin Stars*** | TEXT: Wow! This was the best tasting menu of our lives and we have traveled all around the world. We have been to places with more courses and more creative presentations. However, ranking purely on taste, Friday, Saturday, Sunday is our new number one. Every dish was scrumptious and the service was first rate! We loved the chef’s use of textures with complex flavors and just the right amount of crunch. We can’t wait to come back with other friends and family!	0
TITLE: Great Value | TEXT: Not in the best area of town, but the food was authentic. Been eating Mexican food since I was born and I know and appreciate authentic tasting food. The enchilada sauce was so good, I ordered a small cup of it and poured it over my beans and rice too! The chips were fresh from that day and the salsa had just the right amount of heat for my tastes. I would recmmend this to anyone.	1
TITLE: Unforgettable | TEXT: First time to New Orleans, and chef mentor and foodie Sensei insisted i go to Commander's Palace...he was not wrong, great ambiance, amazing service, although in New Orleans...southern hospitality is alive and well!. My server Joe from Honduras with his team Travis and Gwen, served me and treated me like a southern gentleman. Had the turtle soup and gumbo, perfect flavors and so rich. Had a braised short rib Appetizer on a fried pork skin with cream/sauce...perfect bite to prepare my pallet for my main. Pecan Crusted Fish with crab and finished with their infamous bread pudding soufflé. I was on cloud 9. food was amazing, wanted to lick my plate. I'll Always make time to visit Commanders Palace when i visit Louisiana in the future. hats off to the chef. Exquisite experience.	1
TITLE: The most popular burger on the West Coast | TEXT: In-N-Out Burger is to San Francisco and the West Coast what White Castle is to Chicago and the Midwest. It has been serving quality burgers, fries and shakes since 1948, when it established the first drive-through hamburger stand in California, in Baldwin Park, a Los Angeles suburb. Since then, In-N-Out Burger has opened 424 locations in nine western states. I stopped for lunch at the In-N-Out Burger location at 333 Jefferson Street in the Fisherman's Wharf and North Beach/Telegraph Hill neighborhoods. Open from 10:30 to 1 a.m. Sunday through Thursday and 10:30 to 1:30 a.m. on Friday and Saturday, it offers two versions of its signature burger that has satisfied customers for over 75 years. I ordered a double meat burger, two pure beef patties with lettuce, tomato and onions stacked high on a freshly baked bun and a double-double with two cheese slices, two beef patties, lettuce, tomato, onions and house spread on a toasted bun. With French fries and a chocolate milk shake.and	0
TITLE: Crowded, super noisy and garlicky | TEXT: They pack the restaurant with so many people one can hardly breathe in there. Food is very good but terribly garlicky. They also charge a lot for each mini plate they offer… using the tapas system they get you into ordering many overpriced small garlic bombs. All in all we do not go back although we live nearby as the hassle of being jammed into the noise restaurant is not worth the food.	1
TITLE: Great food and service!! | TEXT: This place is a hidden gem and I can’t understand why it’s not packed!!!  Conch Fritters, smoked fish dip, red shrimp, shrimp po boy were all amazing!!!  Service is great!  Nice laid back place with amazing food!!!	0
TITLE: Fabulous experience | TEXT: It was a fantastic experience. I actually ordered my meal off the neighboring table because The presentation of the food was unbelievable. And our waitress oh my gosh she was fantastic. What a great friendly atmosphere. Can’t wait to go back again. In fact I’m sitting here writing this as we plan to run down there just to eat at the uptown kitchen!!!	0
"TITLE: Worth the visit!!! | TEXT: I was very impressed with the Warren G. Harding Presidential Sites.  We took the tour of his house, and listened first hand from the tour guides all about when Harding gave speeches on the ""front porch"".  The house is stunning and is 90+ percent original from years ago when Warren and his wife Florence lived in the house.  The tour guides can answer any questions you have off the top of their heads.  The  Library & Museum was finished in the spring of 2021 and they have a nice gift shop in there too.  They spared no expense in the construction of the building - it is beautiful!!!!  If you are a history buff, this is a must do."	1
TITLE: Good good | TEXT: This was a pretty cool restaurant with an authentic feel! My grilled chicken was okay, I needed extra sauce to enhance the flavor though. My friend had the jerk chicken and she said it was delicious. Our waitress/bartender was really nice and helpful. The location is spacious and I loved the decor as well. The strip mall means plenty of open parking! I will definitely return!	1
"TITLE: From Unforgettable to Just Fine—A Bittersweet Return to Zahav | TEXT: Our second visit to Zahav was highly anticipated, as our first experience two years ago was nothing short of extraordinary. Two years ago, we were blown away--not just by the incredible food but also by the warmth of the experience, with Executive Sous Chef at that time, Joe Howard, personally bringing out a few dishes he was working on. The sheer amount of food, the flavors, and the hospitality made it one of the most memorable dining experiences of our lives. Naturally, we knew it would be hard to recreate that magic, but we were eager to try. Securing a reservation is no easy feat, but we managed, and while the experience wasn't bad by any means, a few things dampened the excitement. The biggest disappointment was our seating. Instead of being in the vibrant main dining room--where you can see the kitchen in action, the bar buzzing, and the laffa bread being made--we were placed in a separate room on the outskirts. Unfortunately, this space lacked the energy and charm that makes Zahav so special; it felt more like a standard cafeteria, stripping away a big part of what makes the restaurant's atmosphere so unique. The menu had also changed, and we opted for the Tayim menu. While everything was good, it lacked the ""wow"" factor we had experienced before. In some cases, the descriptions of the dishes were more impressive than the actual flavors. Additionally, while our first visit left us completely full, this time, the meal felt smaller. To be clear, the service was great--attentive, professional, and even including an extra salmon tartar and lovely extra dessert for our birthday. There was no particular fault in any one aspect, but together, the little things added up, making this visit fall short of our high expectations. That said, we're still giving five stars, with the hope that Zahav will return to the unforgettable experience it once was."	1
TITLE: Reminiscing about German food | TEXT: We were told about this restaurant by friends. We were disappointed in little ways. Husband thought his cordon bleu was a little small. And possibly from a frozen food box. The salad was good and so was the red cabbage. My sauerkraut with mushrooms was not as tasty as I thought it should be. I thought there should be some pork flavor in it to tone it down. My fish fillet was breaded and crispy. I didn’t expect it to be breaded. The fish was good in itself. The staff were were very nice. It was crowded for a Sunday afternoon. I expected to reminisce to an Old town German quiet place with old German music quietly in the background. This place is youthful and lively!  The beer looked good!  We will continue looking elsewhere.	1
TITLE: Wet Behind the Bear's Ears | TEXT: Week long educational outing with a small group that was really educational and fun.  Seeing Bear's Ears National Monument for the first time was breathtaking.  The depth of knowledge from the scholars and coordinators on the excursion was very helpful.  Our native cultures are still alive and well and we all should explore while we have the opportunity.  Crow Canyon respects our Native American lands and wants to preserve and share with everyone.	0
TITLE: Busy, delicious to-go options in the heart of downtown Philly | TEXT: Crowded and bustling, between the tight fits amid the narrow aisles, you can find some amazing greasy-spoon lunch options frequented by tourists and locals alike.  There are several great options for cheesesteak and various Asian fare.  Best to get anything to-go, though, because tables are hard to come by and packed in tightly together where they do exist.	1
TITLE: Delicious food, great service and comfortable atmosphere | TEXT: We had an excellent dining experience and were well looked after from the moment we arrived. The food was delicious at a reasonable price. The atmosphere was relaxed and enjoyable	0
TITLE: Mostly very good | TEXT: Our tasting menu dinner was very good, everything that was erved was sublime except the beef course and the dessert. The beef wasn't an especially tender cut, and the dessert tangerine sorbet had a rather bland flavor.  But I would defineatly go again, for a special occasion. The cocktails were really really good.	1
TITLE: Great Experience | TEXT: The food was great.  We sat outside and they had the fire pit going, which set off a nice ambience.  And our server Greg was very attentive and recommended the crab stuff Cod, I’m glad he did because it was excellent.	0
TITLE: Worth a try | TEXT: Food was generally OK, but nothing special.  Overpriced and oversalted. Since it has a bar,and there are very few in town, it was worth a try	1
"TITLE: Popped-in for lunch and a couple ""Huge"" beers.... | TEXT: Stopped on Bourbon St. (not my favorite locale) at Cornet.  Had the Chicken Alfredo pasta dish, superb!  But the better surprise was meeting the bartendress, Miss Nina.  What a treasure!  Has lived around the US (although originally from NOLA) and returned here.  The food was exceptional, the locals nice, and Miss Nina wonderful.  This is on my stop-list whenever I'm in NOLA now..."	0
TITLE: It was walking into a ToysRus store | TEXT: I had read many reviews online and asked staff at my hotel all the food market. It was a 10-15 walk from my hotel and walking to the Reading Terminal Market was like walking into a toy store and not knowing what toy you want buy first.  There was so much  choices  of food available.  After walking round the market for around 10 minutes looking to see what I fancied I eventually chose a vender and had my first Philly cheesesteak.  Delicious, will defo go back again before I leave. Must do place for a visit.	0
TITLE: Dinner with Marty | TEXT: What a beautiful place here they got in Portland. Me and Marty had such a fun time when we stopped in to town. We always wanted to come up here for the view but holy cow everything was perfect. Mitchel the bartender was so sweet and knew every question we asked like a pro. The Lobster was so big! 10/10	1
TITLE: First Time Couldn't have Been Better! | TEXT: Our and our friends first time at Commander's Palace!  Service was amazing... a coordinated team effort lead by our waiter.  Food was also amazing with all 8 of us more than happy with every course leading to deserts that just blew us away.  Finally, a manager (one of the family) , who had been making sure we were enjoying our meal, invited us to see the open kitchen and wine cellar, topping off an amazing evening!	0
TITLE: Great Service | TEXT: Wanted try new place & enjoyed my meal here. Had spicy tuna & it was D-lish!! Edamame was perfect & beer was cold. Will return.	0
TITLE: ok | TEXT: last-minute choice for lunch. I had a turkey club, no cheese no sprouts. Oddly it was served with tortilla chips and salsa. The sandwich was actually quite good and I enjoyed it. Hubby had the grilled pork chop with mashed potatoes and roasted beets. They were also.	1
TITLE: Just right | TEXT: This vegetarian food actually tastes like something. The chili was excellent, with lots of fresh ingredients that worked well together. The two other dinners were quite good as well. This place is relaxed and unpretentious.	1
TITLE: Very Nice Dinner Place on SE Milwaukie Ave | TEXT: We have driven by this place numerous times including during the summer time where the outside patio is packed with people and always wondered what the attraction was. We finally stopped in for dinner recently and we were pleasantly surprised.   The interior seemed somewhat small but inviting and very nicely laid out. We were warmly greeted and promptly seated. We ordered some food items recommended by the waitress which was the fish and chips and the hand cut pasta with wild boar meat. Both items were very tasty with the fish and chips being some of the best I have had in the Portland area. We also ordered a desert that was a mint cheesecake with chocolate chips which was very tasty.   Between the great service and food, we will be back.	0
TITLE: An interesting little museum with Spitfire simulator more suited to teens and adults | TEXT: Before we visited I rang up to check the Spitfire simulator would be a suitable activity for our 4 grandchildren who were visiting us during Half Term. I explained that the youngest is only 8 (they recommend 9) but is almost 9 and is quite tall (to reach the pedals) The person I spoke to was friendly and helpful and reassured me it would be fine but suggested we book a 1 hour session which we did. This cost £70 which I thought was reasonable value for 4 of them to have a try.   On arriving at the centre, the person at the front desk was very helpful and suggested that we could park one of our cars for free in the drive at the side as they only had one staff car parked there that day. We parked the other one (as we had 4 children with us) in the  Pay car park at the other side.   The centre itself is small but with some interesting exhibits. There is also a video which they can put on and that is very informative about the role of the ADA during the war. And there’s a dressing up section which amused the children who weren’t on the simulator and which kept them out of the way as I was a bit concerned that the guy supervising  (Richard) was slightly flustered by the number of them!! He said quite sharply that he needed to know this in advance and I explained that I had called to check that would be ok.  In the event they did all have the opportunity to operate the simulator, to loop the loop, do a barrel role and land the plane. And they all said they enjoyed it but said later that they didn’t really feel they were doing it themselves as Richard had his hands on the controls at all times……..possibly in case they crashed it??!! And I don’t think he took to our youngest grandson who went last and was definitely over-confident which possibly annoyed Richard.  All in all, I think it’s probably more suited to older children or adults who may have had more experience with video games than ours have.  Our oldest grandson (at nearly 12) was the one who found it most interesting. The youngest was actually the most enthusiastic but was a bit too boisterous for Richard’s liking!! I also think that if I had been in charge I would probably have structured it differently. I think he could have explained the more general rules to all of them at the start and then allowed each of them to have a turn. Instead he went through with each individually which took more time and therefore reduced the time available for the flying.	1
TITLE: Amazing small plates | TEXT: We visited for the second time.  I am a pretty picky eater and more of a traditionalist in terms of my food.  Last time I was a little more experimental but this time I did the cheeseburger (a new add to their menu) and frittes.  We also did the grilled little gems (a lettuce).  That burger was amazing!  It's not big and not loaded with stuff on top.  But it's the right size to allow you to sample other things and is one of my top favorite burgers in town!  The frittes are crisp, thin, salty - perfect.  The gems were very good.  My husband had the Culottes which was excellent.  He also had the trout which he said was great (I'm not a fish person).    The previous trip we tried dessert and were not impressed.  Nothing enticed this time either.  But I see online they have a strawberry dish and considering and hoping they may use hood strawberries it may be worth trying!  We will be back - a new neighborhood favorite for us!	1
TITLE: Good location and friendly staff…. | TEXT: This hotel is in a good location, a short walk to Bayswater tube station. It’s a safe location for a solo traveller. The  staff at the front desk were friendly and helpful. The single room was very cramped and the bathroom was so small it was almost impossible to use. Eventually I gave up on the shower, as, even for a normal sized person, it was a struggle to manoeuvre in and out. The breakfast room which I tried  only  once, was small and cramped as were the hallways and passageways. There’s a good cafe just around the corner. Some rooms may be bigger, so might be worth checking those out.	1
"TITLE: Still A Star | TEXT: Over 7 years since my last visit and this wonderful restaurant still does not disappoint. All the elements  - service, ambiance, meal - were harmoniously excellent. In particular, my filet and chocolate soufflé were both amongst the best I have ever had. This is now my official  ""Go To"" in San Francisco."	0
TITLE: Fantastic | TEXT: We have been here a few times and the food is amazing, and cooked fresh. The  staff is very friendly and you get great service. We would definitely recommend this restaurant to anyone.	0
TITLE: Not Worthy of Michelin Star | TEXT: I have long since disregarded Michelin ratings as reliable indicators of quality restaurants.  Such is the case of Artiete which has been awarded 1 star for multiple years although totally undeserving in my opinion.  Wife and I arrived 6:15pm last Saturday night and requested one of the many empty outside tables.  We were told they were all pre-reserved and were ushered to a table in the darkest area of the restaurant that already resembles a dungeon.  The hostess begrudgingly moved us to a more acceptable table.  As others have noted, the background music, which included Latin Rap, was oppressively loud.  We ordered the grouper and snapper dishes and both lacked taste and were otherwise undistinguishable. When the server asked our likings for dessert, I ordered flan and coffee.  The server indicated the coffee machine was broken and coffee was not available.  In over 70 years of restaurant dining, I never experienced a restaurant not being able to serve coffee.  So we left unfulfilled noting the outside tables were still vacant 1 1/2 hours after we first arrived.  $24 cocktails and limited expensive parking are further reasons one should patronize alternative restaurants.	1
TITLE: A++ Korean Restaurant | TEXT: Toro is a family owned restaurant that serve many delicious Korean dishes; in addition to Sushi and other popular Asian dishes. The food and service is always good, and reasonable priced. I highly recommend going there for lunch / dinner.	0
TITLE: It was a fantastic experience, and I will be coming back. | TEXT: It was my family's first visit, and we were thrilled to find Uptown Kitchen after returning from our holiday trip and searching for a brunch spot. The service and hospitality were outstanding—Lancy, our server and several managers, warmly greeted our table. The food was exceptional; every dish was delicious and arrived in a timely manner. We experienced a brief wait of less than 10 minutes for our party of seven, but that just showed how popular the place is! I highly recommend Uptown Kitchen and am already planning my next visit.	1
TITLE: Awful Stay and Hotel in Poor Condition | TEXT: DO NOT STAY AT THIS COMFORT INN! First it’s deceptive to say it’s at Main Gate at Ft Jackson (exit 12) when it’s several miles away st Exit 9. This hotel is old and dated and carpets are extremely dirty, paint issues everywhere and deferred maintenance. We checked in and had to be moved 3 times due to room issues. Room 200 had a leak in the ceiling with water dripping on floor and plaster falling from the season! While they are in the process of updating rooms on the first floor it still has major issues and not a Comfort Inn expectation. We also had someone outside our room in the parking lot from 9pm- 1am with car stereo playing loud and thumping while they smoked pot. No security and didn’t feel safe. Other options like Springhill Suites or Holiday Inn Express was priced the same and would have been better options. We would have checked out and moved but had a Nonrefundable reservation! This property needs to be closed and reopened when totally remodeled!	1
TITLE: Portland City Grill Delivers | TEXT: Best dining experience ever!  We wet for dinner and had the seafood tower, it was so good.  If you ever visit Portland, the City Grill is where you need to go!	0
TITLE: Slice of Germany in Stockton? | TEXT: We were in the area for the day and delighted to find this German restaurant for dinner. I'm not super familiar with German food, but we thought the schnitzel, sausage, and potato pancakes were especially tasty. Great beer on tap, too, and they let you sample for free. We had so much fun. Highly recommend!	1
TITLE: Joyful | TEXT: Quick service and anticipation. I really loved being served in the mornings by Luis Balboa. In the Devon day he already knew what I wanted	1
TITLE: Don’t Miss this Indoor Outdoor Museum on the Hill! | TEXT: Most of our itenerary for Jackson was outdoors, but we kept passing the hillside with the museum’s quartzite walls cutting into the slope and drove up. I love sculpture and have a minor in art, so the sculpture trail hooked me and also brought me inside. The placement of each animal across from the Elk Refuge is so perfect and acts like a canvas in complimenting each sculpture. I especially loved “Great Northern” and “The Emperor” on the walk. We had a delicious lunch at the museum then enjoyed the interior art. “Chief” was magnificent. The museum is first class!	0
TITLE: A Stockton tradition… | TEXT: It’s nice after having been away for over a decade to eat at one of Stockton’s most reliable Mexican restaurants: Cancun.  Very friendly and fast-moving staff with all the classic, tasty fare.  I got the chicken enchiladas.  Fun, open space a short walk from most downtown places of importance.  Support this legend of downtown!	0
TITLE: Visited twice, that’s enough, too busy for a relaxing time | TEXT: Nice spot, parking close by, reservations needed for dinner, show. Dinner pricey for what is served. Nice atmosphere. Seafood disappointing. Oxtail, Mac n cheese good, cornbread very good. Wait staff good but busy. Music a bit too loud, seated in back but still loud.	1
TITLE: Wonderful oysters and patio scene | TEXT: Visited last weekend, sat outside on the patio and enjoyed a cocktail, oysters and pizza. It was delightful, the staff was attentive and the people watching was perfect. Best oysters I’ve had outside of dining in Maine!	0
TITLE: Fantastic Asian cuisine | TEXT: Benu was fabulous. I had rarely visited a fine dining Asian restaurant but all the food here was genuinely faultless. From a plump sea urchin starter to a delicious fish dish to delicate desserts, the kitchen clearly knows how to create elegant and flavourful dishes. This was one of the best Michelin starred restaurants I've been to. The restaurant is led by Corey Lee, who for a long time was the head chef at Thomas Keller's 3 Michelin-starred restaurant, 'The French Laundry' in Yountville.	0
TITLE: Week long travel with Crow Canyon in Southwest | TEXT: I have travelled with Crow Canyon more than 8 times; mostly in the Southwest. I would label this travel adventure travel.  You are in a small group with at least two scholars, one an archeologist and one a related field.    I have learned so much and had access to so many archeological sites I would not otherwise be allowed to visit.  The trip leaders are full time employees who are very professional and experienced.  These trips are unique learning experiences.  Additionally, I have developed many lasting friendships with other persons I have met on the trips....we all share common interests  which adds to our own experiences.	1
TITLE: Nothing amazing, but it was a good place to stop. | TEXT: I got the shrimp caesar salad which was pretty tasty. The prices were extremely reasonable too. The restaurant was really busy and there was only 2 servers. It took forever to get our food. I may go back when they're not so busy.	1
TITLE: Amazing Greek Cuisine | TEXT: Yasoo Yani has a great menu - the Gyros salad is the bomb and the pita bread is so fresh and delicious!!	0
TITLE: Amazing food great service. | TEXT: What an amazing food. Authentic without any compromise. The Tacos are a must, we ordered a second portion and the Mai’s with wild crab is simply the best dish I had in a long time. This combined with an amazing service made this the best dinner during our trip in Miami. Thank you	0
TITLE: The Best | TEXT: This restaurant never fails to delight. Service is high quality. Food is fresh and tasty. Love the charm of the place. I take all our visitors there and everyone, family, friends, etc love it and ask to go again!	0
TITLE: Wet Behind the Bear's Ears | TEXT: Week long educational outing with a small group that was really educational and fun.  Seeing Bear's Ears National Monument for the first time was breathtaking.  The depth of knowledge from the scholars and coordinators on the excursion was very helpful.  Our native cultures are still alive and well and we all should explore while we have the opportunity.  Crow Canyon respects our Native American lands and wants to preserve and share with everyone.	0
TITLE: Exceptional! | TEXT: Beautiful setting after dark with twinkly lights, candles and Christmas tree.  Cozy and warm when it was blustery outside.  Great staff.  I can always tell a good menu when there are a few things I really want and can't make up my mind.    Deviled eggs with smoked salmon were a little meh, but the potato croquettes were heavenly.   Two of our group settled on the happy hour burger with a salad, both were flavorful and delicious, two others had steak frites with a drizzly of chimichurri sauce, also delicious.    Good cocktails.  This was our second time and it was every bit as good as the first, just a different (and special) experience eating inside.  Great place for a romantic date.  Street parking.	1
TITLE: Wouldn’t recommend | TEXT: I went to FARE with my sisters for the first time ; I was excited to try the food ! The customer service was TRASH and the food wasn’t that good either ! We literally waited for the check for 20mins . The server was really rude ! I had to say it twice	1
TITLE: Left in 30 minutes | TEXT: VERY loud with tables literally about 4-6 inches apart.  You could hear everything neighboring tables were saying but very little of your partner's comments.  I like a dry white wine with Mediterranean food but none available (excluding two bubbly options). Only one vodka brand available so you are limited to cocktails (mainly rum) or beer. While we left in about 30 minutes, flat bread pizza was overcooked by had good flavors and the octopus was tough but again, had a nice flavor.  Big crowd so appears popular, but we will not go back - too many other great options out there.	1
TITLE: Customer service at its best! | TEXT: Truly a historic gem (circa 1925) restored to modern day convenience. Good amenities in a great location.   Perhaps the best part was my experience at breakfast this morning. The standard Holiday Inn Express offerings were very well prepared (e.g., perfectly moist and appealing scrambled eggs) and the attendants distinguished themselves by their continuous checks and attention to detail like wiping up spills. However, the MOST REMARKABLE service I witnessed was when one of the two attendants noticed a guest (walking with a cane) needing assistance as he served his plate from the buffet. She respectfully approached him and offered her help. It was spontaneous kindness and true customer service at its best!  Both my day and my trip were made better by seeing the above (while also enjoying a tasty, filling breakfast)!  I will be back!	1
TITLE: awesome  motel | TEXT: this place is great  the innkeeper calls if your late   he leaves a bbq with propane full  balcony for smokers kitchenette  is fully stocked so you dont have to go out to dinner we pack dinner and breakfast  great coffee shop downtown and restaurants also  clean and quiet	1
TITLE: Archeological Research Program (ARP) at Crow Canyon | TEXT: I recently completed my fourth Archeological Research Program (ARP) at Crow Canyon.  The three previous ARP programs I've participated in were all mostly archeological digging.  I wasn't sure what to expect with the site survey program, but it was a great learning experience as the first part of the archeological process.  The week flew by as I was having fun and learning a lot.  The Crow Canyon instructors even slightly changed our itinerary because our group had so many questions about the entire process for site, so we had extra lab time to go over the lab processes.  I would definitely recommend the ARP program or any of the other programs Crow Canyon offers for furthering your adult learning on indigenous history.	1
TITLE: French room experience | TEXT: A Good experience and Carlos was super friendly and knowledgeable with everything. Def recommend trying this spot. Variety and good service	0
TITLE: Worth a try | TEXT: We needed a last minute reservation for a larger party and there was not much available in the North End so we decided to try this place on Beacon Hill. It's in a basement so don't be surprised when you arrive. I had the scallops and they were very good.  The rest of my party enjoyed their food as well. While efficient, the staff was not very helpful or friendly.  We asked for a couple of suggestions in regards to the food and did not really receive much input. A bit more of a welcome would have put a much better spin on this place for us.  It's worth a try though as food was good.	1
TITLE: Best brunch in years | TEXT: The menu was very unique giving the 4 of us the opportunity to try new things and everything was excellent! The flavors just combined to make everything so tasty. Service was good and the total price very reasonable for the quality of the food and the time we were able to spend there as a small group.	0
TITLE: Very disappointed | TEXT: I’ll start by saying I hate to leave reviews & usually don’t; so when u do it’s only when I’m very impressed or very disappointed. I’ve been here several times & never been disappointed. This time was different unfortunately. My first red flag was when our food came out in less than ten minutes. Fresh food takes longer than that to cook. My partner & I came by for dinner because she wanted the trout salad. Which she seemed to enjoy.  I was in the mood for white fish so I ordered the pan fried Idaho trout piccata, with broccolini & lemon mushroom risotto.  Sadly, the menu said nothing about the trout actually being farm raised steelhead (I hate steelhead) so that was my first disappointment.  Next, the risotto was complete mush. I asked the server to ask the kitchen when it was made. He said it was “prepped” yesterday. Having spent 20! Years in the culinary industry including culinary school I know what that means.   @ lastly, the broccoli was just unseasoned broccoli. Zero salt, pepper, or butter. The server was friendly enough & not rude at all, but when I made my disappointment visually & audibly known, he showed & offered zero in the way of fixing the situation. I did say that will take the remaining 2/3rds of the disappointing meal to go partner would have it at work later,  so I understand that. I despise people who complain just to get free stuff & so that’s why I try not to leave bad feedback.  I think the biggest disappointment was that from my very first sign of displeasure, there was no offer to fix the situation from beginning to end.  I left the couple stars because the staff were fine. But I won’t return.	1
TITLE: Wow, wow, wow | TEXT: Wow, wow, wow.  Fabulous dinner, great service, cool / intimate setting. We were just walking by and stopped in, hadn’t no idea how great the experience would be. Outstanding meal.	0
TITLE: Excellent experience for my birthday in Miami | TEXT: Amazing food with the best mac & cheese and potato puree sides I've ever tasted! Location is very beautiful with lots of fairy lights, plants and high rise buildings outside. The staff were attentive, friendly and upbeat. Stylish modern restaurant with great cocktails, I ordered the 'Message from Gordon', The steak was cooked to perfection and we had the best time. Thank you for an amazing birthday experience ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️	1
TITLE: Food Experience for Foodies | TEXT: A dinner absolutely worthy of a Michelin Star. Food was unique, creatively prepared and delicious. The wait staff (primarily Evan) were attentive and friendly. Co-owner Jill visited tables. A lively vibe with a mixed crowd.  Extensive  wine list in addition to curated pairings. The Lion’s Mane Mushroom was amazing, presented in a thick cut, steak-like format and tasted much the same. I could be a vegetarian after eating it!   For those who previously offered criticism of: Price:  Check out similarly starred restaurants and  you’ll appreciate their price point.  Noise:  Yes it’s lively but we had absolutely no issues carrying on a conversation and discussing the creative preparations  Included Gratuity:  Really folks??  Where have you been for the past few years?  Who doesn’t give a 20% gratuity for good service and more for great service? Great job Team Tail Up Goat!!  We will highly recommend to others for a fun and delicious foodie experience in DC.	0
TITLE: Wonderful spot for memorable sushi! | TEXT: Wait staff not very attentive, ran out of water twice had to ask for more. Was not warned how Spicy the three spicy rolls I ordered were-if there’s a jalapeño next to roll be warned it’s hot, had a hard time finish rolls, food was excellently prepared and fresh! Highly recommend this place for sushi and appetizers were big and unique.	1
TITLE: Predictable food, not the best service! | TEXT: At the Hard Rock Cafe in New Orleans, the atmosphere is typical of the chain, but the experience was marred by unfriendly service; we only saw our waitress a couple of times. We chose this restaurant specifically for a fresh salad, as options on Bourbon Street tend to lean heavily toward gumbo, jambalaya, and étouffée, which wasn't what we were craving in the heat. Fortunately, the Cobb salad and southwestern bowl were both delicious and hit the spot. Despite the service issues, I would consider visiting again for the food.	1
TITLE: We watched a short film at the museum prior to the tour | TEXT: Our guide was Theodore, he did an excellent job sharing his knowledge of Warren Harding and Florence- marriage, campaign and presidency. The tour started on the porch where his Porch Campaign took place. The house furnishings are over 90% original. NO Pictures allowed which is sad for my personal journey ablum. The museum has nice exhibits with a couple audios. Enjoyed watching the pictures taken on the Voyage of Understanding tour to the western states and Alaska. Purchase tickets on-line because we were shocked how the first 3 tours were fully booked. We changed our itinerary to make a late afternoon tour. Large parking lot. Restrooms on site.	1
TITLE: Quintessential Italian Fine Dining!!!! | TEXT: We have eaten all over the greater Jacksonville area (and far beyond), and this remains our family’s favorite for good reason…owner Jerry’s passion for quality translates to a rich, immersive dining experience that you won’t soon forget.  Dress nicely, bring your favorite people, prepare for exceptional service and cuisine by the best in the business, and let the experience begin!	0
TITLE: Cozy restaurant near Washington Square. | TEXT: We were in town to celebrate my wife's birthday. We tried this restaurant on a recommendation from my boss. The food was delicious. I had the Branzino and Broccoli, my wife had the Roasted Chicken and Gnocchi. We shared the the Chocolate Pudding cake which was delicious also. My wife really like the bread plates on each table. Each plate was different from the next and look like someone went searching thru some antique shops to pick them out. We ate inside because it was a little to windy to try the patio but it looked really and cozy.	0
TITLE: Very noisy. not very Japanese | TEXT: The noise level mood to be mentioned first. We practally had to scream to talk to each other.   Service was good with lots of staff. One person, possibly the sushi chef or restaurant owner was Asian. The rest of the staff and the cooking style had a big Mexican influence.  We had a tuna with avocado and jalapeño roll. Also spicy ramen. I liked it but had indigestion afterwards which is a first for Japanese food. The tempura was very greasy.   I do not recommend his restaurant.	1
TITLE: Sophisticated, relaxed and quality. | TEXT: What a great night out. The ambience was perfect for us, high end yet relaxed and a bit dressy. The food was superb. We started with the mackerel and asparagus which were both perfectly cooked and delicious, light and fresh. I had the agnolotti and my husband had the Iberian pork. The agnolotti was perfectly al dente and the flavors were fresh,  balanced and very tasty. The pork was flavourful and tender, and the service was wonderful. I rate this an A+. It just all came together for a relaxing Night with wonderful food.	1
"TITLE: Prioritize my bladder!!!! | TEXT: Hello, I regret  to inform you that your staff needs to be engaged in coaching, due to the lack of attention to a female and I needing to use the restrooms after multiple attempts to utilize them. I was ignored by the first female and was given a puzzled look that they can't be opened. After I went around to seek attention from the other staff she rudely stated both bathrooms are not available, after I asked why she said "" they just are "". I asked to see what would cause them to be unusable but could only feel discriminated as she added no urgency to the issue. She then asked if I was management to even request to see the inside of the bathrooms. As a LONG TIME CUSTOMER. I suggest to keep your client based loyal to address this issue as it leaves a bad image on the franchise. I left feeling ""I didn't have it my way "". And that's just a bowl movement. Thank you for your time and I hope this matter has been addressed the next time I pass by the store as I will try to obtain pictures of the staff reluctant to assist. Best regards, JJ."	1
TITLE: Worse tasting overpriced chicken parm I ever had in my life | TEXT: I just moved to this town and was dying for a chicken Parm sandwich, and did not feel like going through the trouble of making it myself. Well, I certainly should have because this was the worst tasting chicken Parmesan sandwich I’ve ever had. I asked for extra cheese there was no cheese no sauce and when I first looked at it, I thought they had given me eggplant by mistake. That’s how thin and burnt the chicken cutlet was. It was literally all bread no meat to thin hockey pucks just terrible and they charged me $16 for it. Very very upset never again will I ever eat here!	1
TITLE: Spooky entrance reminded me of the Bates Motel. | TEXT: The ONLY motel in town, You must drive through a one lane alley and down a slope to the parking area, then climb metal stairs to access checkin. The room was musty, but otherwise a clean kitchenette. The manager provides Tim Hortons coffee and donuts in the AM.	1
TITLE: Great ambiance  and food. | TEXT: Had a wonderful time at Cassidy’s. We ordered off the specials menu … “Short ribs over Risotto” Divine! Tip; Always order off the specials menus as it is always revolving and delicious. The ambiance is classic old Portland with its oak bar, wood floors and wood paneled walls.	1
TITLE: Another great dining experience. | TEXT: We were able to eat here again pre- cruise after a visit a few years back.   We were seated promptly at a nice table.  Service as before was exceptional as was the food. The portions are huge, so we  shared some appetizers and the veal parmigiana.   Everyone was  very professional and I love the decor.	1

TITLE: Pretty restaurant in bishop arts district known more by the locals. | TEXT: This restaurant has a lovely interior decor and large fun patio in a lively area of Dallas, the Bishop Arts District. The place was very pretty for Christmas the holidays. Our server was nice but not super attentive and the food was pretty good not great and not above average. We ate early and it was still very loud in there so if it's a quiet meal you are seeking this place is on the loud side acoutiscally. I would like to go back for a drink on the patio in warmer weather. Lots of photo spots throughout.	1
TITLE: Exceeded Our High Expectations | TEXT: It's unusual to go to a restaurant with such high expectations, only to have all those expectations exceeded in every way.  That was our experience at Kann.  Service by Chris and his team was impeccable.  Timing of plates was perfect, we were never rushed, the table was kept spotless, everyone was attentive without hovering.  The meal itself was fantastic.  We over ordered so we could try more dishes, and ended up taking a bunch home.  To be honest, I think i enjoyed the appetizers and sides as much as the main courses, but everything was spectacular.  I am gluten and dairy free due to allergies, and I was in heaven, knowing I could order just about anything on the menu and be safe.  Thank you!  We will make another reservation and wait our three months to get in - it was just a perfect, perfect meal in every way.  Oh, and be sure to save room for dessert!	1
TITLE: Phenomenal flavors! | TEXT: Phenomenal flavors! My husband and I always enjoy experiencing different restaurants when we travel and this was our favorite food of the trip by far. Flavors were complex & interesting while remaining balanced - I had so much fun tasting every bite of the meal. Highly recommend!	1
TITLE: First rate, highly recommended | TEXT: Highly rated French restaurant, with an exceptionally high quality menu. Prices are reasonable for the excellent quality and service tips are built into the prices you see on the menu.	0
TITLE: Fine dining excellence | TEXT: Amazing dining experience from the drinks we had to start all the way to the decadent desert... flawless! We can't wait to return.	0
TITLE: Comfortable Clean Overnight Stop if you are on a car trip | TEXT: Interesting concept for those driving.  self checkin with your car ( but we had help) the garage door opens and also one at your room.  prive into your personal garage and them close the dorr and walk up the stairs to your room.  Its a very nice room with a spa and lovely bed - but no refrigerator :-( .  THey have great room service from a corridor that runs behind all the rooms.  Great if you dont have teh need to go out and walk around.  Its in a commercial area so car is needed to get there and to go out to stretch your legs and explore in any case.  We would stay again but we were only there to sleep and have a bite.	1
TITLE: Amazing! | TEXT: Excellent service. Amazing food! The servers treated us very well. And explained each course very good. All in all an amazing experience!	0
TITLE: Exceptional knowledge provided, kindness and a very professional crew. | TEXT: Unforgettable experience. The knowledge shared by sme’s was invaluable. The world needs Crow Canyon!   The expertise and educational opportunities provided by the center was exceptional. I highly recommend trips with Crow Canyon often.	0
TITLE: Amazing food | TEXT: Amazing food, quaint and inviting location, and overall one of our best dinners while traveling ever!  We had the special Valentine's Day menu and it did not disappoint!	0
TITLE: Food was very good but service needs some work | TEXT: When we entry the restaurant no one greeted us or said anything to us. Few minutes later, we were told to follow him. I was not impressed with the service but the food was very good.	1
TITLE: A tasty Chinese diner in this cosy restaurant. | TEXT: This restaurant is locatedin the main shopping street of Roden. We arrived at about 18 o'clock, there were a number of take away custommers and we were the only guests in the restaurant area. We choose to sit near the window. The friendly waitress showed us the menu and served a good strong green tea and a flavourful jasmin tea. We ordered Prawn crackrs, Fu Yong Hay with large Prawns and Mi Fan with Siu Yok (roasted Pork) and Cha Siew (sweet roasted pork) . The dishes were prepared in the Chinese way and  tasty, as per my Chinese wife. We recommend this restaurant.	0
TITLE: Birthday Celebration | TEXT: We celebrated my wife’s 70th birthday.  The staff was very accommodating to the group.  The scenery was very appealing inside and out.  The marina situated just off the patio decking was nice.  The food was outstanding!  Treat yourself to a wonderful meal at the Point!	0
"TITLE: Wonderful Happy Hour at Bellevue! | TEXT: Very elegant setting with welcoming and attentive servers.  The happy hour wine, crispy Brussel sprout medley, Parmesan truffle fries were all delicious!  Background music streaming from Spotify - various artists ""Summer Barbeque""  was so much fun families of multiple generations felt compelled to jive along !  Please view the submitted photos that capture the essence of the lovely XIX BAR LOUNGE."	0
TITLE: Great Service | TEXT: Service was fast & efficient. Food was hot & tortilla  fresh and flavorful. Shrimp salad was fresh & tasty. Beer was ice cold. View was great.	1
TITLE: ANOTHER GREAT MEAL | TEXT: Another year,another visit,my wife and I and two friends,visited tonight,we were shown to our pre booked table by Mehmet,we had a great view of the harbour and village,we had free homemade bread and a dip to start,followed by chicken in bacon sauce and chicken & salmon in almond sauce,which is exactly what we had last year,and as last year,both were excellent as was the service. Maybe the best meal so far!	0
TITLE: Pleasant place for drinks and dessert | TEXT: During our stay, we stopped by the XIX lounge for drinks and dessert.  My wife and I were each treated to a generous pour of a good chardonnay, which had just a bit of residual sweetness.  We also shared a portion of the chocolate mousse, which was very satisfying.  Prices are a little on the high side, but that's to be expected when you're in a classy location like the Bellevue.	0
TITLE: Beyond Great Experience Wilder Philadelphia! | TEXT: 2/26/25 Year End Celebration work lunch in semi-private space upstairs. Exceeded our expectations on all fronts! Food, staff, service, beautiful space. Worked closely with Brett who owns Wilder with his partner Nicole. I let Brett know that is was wonderful and we cannot wait to return for another work event and to bring family and friends.  Thanks for everything Brett!	0
TITLE: Best roasted potatos ever! | TEXT: Beautiful place. Went for brunch. Food was great although my eggs could have been warmer. Service was good and friendly but as the place filled up—our reservation was at opening time—our waitress disappeared. However, really enjoyed it and would visit again.	1
TITLE: Good food, quite restaurant | TEXT: We went on a Monday night so it wasn't to busy, sat at bar.  Had calamari not bad, could have been cooked longer.  Pork saltimbocca was very good served with spinach.  Bill was $50 without any drinks!	1
TITLE: Romantic dinner | TEXT: Wonderful dinner and service.  The lamb chops were delicious and the presentation was wonderful. Great wine selection!	0
TITLE: November Stay | TEXT: Staff were very nice and hotel was very clean. I think the pictures make the rooms look bigger than they truly are- they do say it that rooms are small and cozy- it is truly SMALL AND COZY. Small that 2 people can barely walk at the same time. If you are clear on that you will have a fabulous stay- if you skip over that detail (like me) you may be confused. Aside from the small rooms they do offer a nice breakfast. The hotel is close to everything- trains, food, convenience stores and the casino. It is the perfect location for a visit to Chicago.	1
TITLE: Unstuffy culinary hotspot | TEXT: We came here for dinner while visiting friends who live in the area, and had a wonderful meal!  The ambiance is upscale and trendy without being stuffy, and it was very clear that this is a culinary hotspot. The staff were professional and friendly - our waitress was very helpful when we were struggling to decide what to order. The crispy duck, salmon satay, tempura cauliflower, and the general tso soup were outstanding! We ended up not leaving anything for leftovers, which doesn't generally happen with us. We'll definitely come back the next time we're in town.	1
TITLE: If the locals are always here, it’s got to be good. And it was great! | TEXT: Rustic environment with excellent food and lots of options. We’ve driven by multiple times on our way to Jacksonville and were determined to stop this time. We got there around 11:45am, hoping to beat the rush, which we did. By the time we left, both the parking lot and restaurant were full. It was very obvious that the vast majority of the folks inside were locals. My wife had fried shrimp - about a dozen large shrimp with a very light coating of batter. Excellent! I wanted something not fried and opted for the full pot of the chowder. Also excellent! They say it’s made fresh daily, and it was. A medium sized pan filled with a tomato based, thick soup with fresh potatoes, celery and large chunks of tuna and diced shrimp. Highly recommend. Also available in a “half pot” if you’re not really hungry. Don’t drive by - go in and enjoy great food and service.	1
TITLE: Hard pass, good location | TEXT: Booked 4 nights stayed for 2. Have stayed in various HIE here and in Europe and you know going in the rooms will be smaller, basic but functional and nice. These rooms were small and considering it was renovated not functional at all. There are so many ways to maximize a small space but that was not done here. They were nice to let us see 2 other rooms and choose after our initial room. Good location, Front desk lady helpful and nice.	1
TITLE: Go for the meal, but stay for the cocktails | TEXT: This was very great restaurant. I had the salmon that was very excellent. I have not had a good piece of salmon in a long time and I was not disappointed. Highlight experience was bartender made me a bourbon cocktail hecwas developing. For those that like manhattans or old fashions, step out of your comfort zone and try a that bourbon pineapple thing. You want be disappointed.	0
TITLE: Delicious | TEXT: Ordered via doorsash. Everything was delicious.  Empanadas and cubanos were very good. Highly recommended. Check order, ours was shorted a cubano but plenty of food for our family.	1
TITLE: Splendid Saison | TEXT: What a splendid meal at Saison. An innovative and tasty set menu with many standout dishes and presentation - lobster tartare, uni, white truffle pasta, duck etc. I would probably skip the wagyu supplement next time since i’m not a fan of wagyu generally   Service top notch and friendly as well  The kitchen tour was a plus  9.5/10	0
TITLE: Wouldn’t recommend | TEXT: I went to FARE with my sisters for the first time ; I was excited to try the food ! The customer service was TRASH and the food wasn’t that good either ! We literally waited for the check for 20mins . The server was really rude ! I had to say it twice	1
TITLE: Great Breakfast | TEXT: Great breakfast with delicious food. Friendly staff and clearly a local favorite. Nice location on the marina for land and boat access!	0
TITLE: Coffee with a Scowl | TEXT: I thought it was a Good morning , until my Daughter snd I got the Evil eye and Coffee with a Scowl. Yikes. How about a smile from the Coffee server .	1
TITLE: Great food Affordable prices | TEXT: The food was delicious. Large portions  and affordable pricing. The employees were super friendly and helpful. I thoroughly enjoyed my meal and would love to eat there again if I am in the area!	0
TITLE: What a disappointment; they missed the mark on nearly everything. | TEXT: We really wanted to like this place.  We live nearby but have never been.  We made a res for 1:45 (late for brunch). The place was 1/2 empty but we were seated at a table for 2 at a banquette squeezed between 2 noisy groups and very close to the front door which brought in icy air.  I looked at a long expanse of empty tables and asked if we could sit over there and was told no; they were expecting a big party.  Note:  the big party arrived one hour later when we were ready to leave.  Also 2 other couples arrived and were seated in the forbidden zone. Okay that was #1.  Then no wait person showed up for a longish period of time: #2: no water; no welcome.  Menu was okay.  We both ordered a different version of a salad with grilled salmon. Mine included a poached egg. #3 poached egg arrived hard boiled. I asked for a replacement t and they did bring me a softly poached, runny egg.  We waited a ridiculous amount of time for someone to refill our iced tea. #4: food was mediocre.  Edible but no where near the quality anticipated based on the prices.  I do not recommend this place and would not go back.  Plenty of far better places a short walk away.	1
TITLE: Quiet retreat. | TEXT: Stayed a couple nights. View is very good and the couple of goats and three wadling ducks were happy to say hello in the paddock below. Some yummy local chocolates and apples provided were great. Was very nice to sit outside on table having a few wines and antipasto watching the sun go down. Quite modern open plan style. Bed wasn't the best but ok, probably just me. Host was very unobtrusive but still stuck in fresh provisions for breaky. Nice spot to just chill and short trip to the ferry for Bruny Island.	1
TITLE: Excellent Tapas Spot | TEXT: Was excited to see this tapas place near our hotel, especially as my colleagues had never tried tapas before. The standards (patatas bravas, pan con tomate, croquettes) were all great. The pork belly was so good we ordered it twice. Would come back again for sure.	1
TITLE: So-So | TEXT: The resturant was clean and service was good. The breakfast were okay although too much lemon on my avocado toast and my husband's toasts were burnt and eggs undercooked. Another morning our breakfast was amazing. I'm not sure if there are different cooks but quality of food is a bit inconsistent.	1
TITLE: Holiday Tea was over the top! | TEXT: Carlos and Jitendra were magnificent! The food was delicious. We had the Holiday Tea. Their service was impeccable. Would definitely recommend and plan to come back!!	0
TITLE: Check your bill | TEXT: I was really disappointed with my recent visit to Sampan on 10/27. The food itself was delicious, but when I got home and looked over my receipt, I realized I was charged for two meals instead of one for several items. I double-checked to make sure it wasn't something I ordered by mistake--it definitely wasn't.  I am not sure how this is even possible since only one item of each was delivered to our table.  Is it a scam???  The total amount overcharged was $109.   I tried calling and emailing the restaurant to sort it out, but haven't been able to get a response yet. Mistakes happen, but overcharging a customer and not fixing it right away doesn't leave a good impression.   Please double-check your bill before you leave!  I hope management sees this and reaches out so this can be corrected.  Table 54	1
TITLE: Too expensive for what you get! | TEXT: For context, we have eaten at several of the top ranked restaurants in the world.  We’re very familiar with the idea of tasting menus.  The staff at the restaurant (ie. Valet, hostess, waiter, etc.) were all very good.  The artistry of the food was good.  The food quality was good.  The menu variety was good.  Having said that, the pace was a bit too slow and not because it was busy.  The major negative critique was that the food quantity was severely lacking.  After spending a few hundred on dinner, I left starving.  The same family owns other restaurants in Jax, one we really enjoy, but I would not recommend this one.  Way too expensive for what you get.	1
TITLE: Mediocre | TEXT: Came for dinner and took almost 10 minutes to locate the place. Really tucked away upstairs. On a Monday night, the restaurant was pretty dead - we were one of 4 tables. Albeit, the view from our table next to the floor to ceiling windows was lovely. Food was ok, overpriced for the basic offerings and portions. The Caesar salad was an interesting take and was probably the highlight of our meal. Our server was very friendly and accommodating but really focused on closing time/pushing us to order.	1
"TITLE: Worth the visit!!! | TEXT: I was very impressed with the Warren G. Harding Presidential Sites.  We took the tour of his house, and listened first hand from the tour guides all about when Harding gave speeches on the ""front porch"".  The house is stunning and is 90+ percent original from years ago when Warren and his wife Florence lived in the house.  The tour guides can answer any questions you have off the top of their heads.  The  Library & Museum was finished in the spring of 2021 and they have a nice gift shop in there too.  They spared no expense in the construction of the building - it is beautiful!!!!

TITLE: Best Street Fajitas Ever! | TEXT: My husband and I stopped in during our road trip to Key West. We sat outside and watched the beach and ocean while eating street fajitas and taco burgers. After we ate lunch we walked across the street to the beach and went down to the water.	0
TITLE: In New Orleans with family and friends. Have always wanted to try Mulates. | TEXT: The food was excellent. I recommend the key lime pie. There was live Zydeco music. Or waitress was very pleasant and knowledgeable. I will return.	0
TITLE: Chicken falling off the bone | TEXT: We ordered two chicken dishes, grape leaves, and rice pudding. We were very excited for the meal and arrived a bit early for our reservation. Chicken mandi and chicken kabsah were fabulous, the chicken was so tender and delicious , and the rice was unique and flavorful. I love rice pudding, which had pistachio on top! Service was timely and the staff are pleasant and knowledgeable. A+ all around!	1
"TITLE: Staff Attitude | TEXT: My first and last time dining at this restaurant. Our server was great but one staff that was working at the backyard was rude and nasty. She was annoyed when I was standing by the door of the restroom which I must say they have a very small place. She kicked me out by saying ""step outside!"" What an attitude treating their customers. We like exploring French restaurants in San Francisco but this will be out of our list and will not recommend. Disappointing!"	1
TITLE: Original Greek Food | TEXT: This is a very old restaurant in Stockton but very busy lunch crowd, the service is old style but very friendly the food is very original an fresh we always get the same Nick’s salad.The menu is pretty big. Good value for your money.	0
TITLE: Excellent service, food, and ambiance! | TEXT: This restaurant was excellent! Small restaurant with great ambiance. Owner is wonderful… professional with a sense of humor. He comes to your table and tells you the extensive menu.  The food was out of this world! We had crab cakes, caprese salad, crusted salmon, rib eye, and key lime pie!	0
TITLE: Not great | TEXT: Food was ok. Staff was rude. Customer service was terrible. Place desperately needed cleaning and updates. Definitely not a coffee shop as the name suggests.	0
TITLE: Good food, poor service | TEXT: Unfortunately we have to give this restaurant three stars, despite the delicious food. We sat at the bar because we did not have a reservation. Bar staff, two young women working at Pesche each for one year, were unfriendly and surly, offering poor service and even to our surprise, rude comments. We ordered several appetizers and a whole redfish, but received zero service after a food runner brought the entree. We were ignored at the bar, asked several times for a drink but did not receive, and experienced very bad, unwelcoming service from these bartenders. We would not return, despite the extremely well prepared food. Thank you to the chef. Bartenders required more training and certainly a lesson in courtesy and manners.	1
TITLE: Best Place to Stay in Southern Pacific Costa Rica!!!! | TEXT: We've traveled all of Costa Rica, nearly 40 trips ( actually, it's 39 trips throughout the country ). The Ballena Coast is our favorite locale, and Many's House is by far, our favorite place to stay. Menachem, is a very attentive  host, and the accommodations are much like home. You will rest comfortably between the ocean, and the rain forest. Many's website, fails to do him justice.....THIS IS THE BEST LOCATION IN SOUTHERN PACIFIC COSTA RICA.........PERIOD!!	0
TITLE: Exceptional all around | TEXT: We went to visit our kids. Saison experience was beyond expectations. Staff game us exceptional service. Food and drinks were well presented and delicious.	0
TITLE: Best pub in Boston | TEXT: Best bar I’ve found in Boston so far. I’m travelling for work as a solo female and may have tried a bar or two (or more) along the way. The staff here are wonderful, location is great with an outdoor sun trap. Loving the people watching and the history that surrounds the pub. Strongly recommend and thank you to the staff.	0
TITLE: Asian fusion in downtown Philadelphia | TEXT: Tasty food late in the evening. We had flown in for the work conference. Not everything’s open late on Sunday evening, so our choices were more limited. This is in a very vibrant area of the city with lots of people still walking around after 8 PM. The food choices were good. It is sort of served family style in that they bring a bowl of the entrée, rice, etc and you share it at the table.  The menu was small, but the food was tasty. Servers were responsive and helpful. It’s a small restaurant and a little bit loud, but I would definitely return again.	1
TITLE: Wonderful! | TEXT: Absolutely wonderful, staff, wine garden & food all above and beyond. Big thanks to Todd and Jess for making this an exceptional birthday!	0
TITLE: Great date night! | TEXT: We went last night for the abbreviated menu and it was delightful.  Perfect service that was both professional and playful.  The smell alone is worth another star.  The food was sublime and the wine pairings were different but matched beautifully.  The chef came by and visited with us and he was lovely.  Beautiful room and a gorgeous kitchen.	0
TITLE: Little hidden gem... | TEXT: When I visit Berlin, I always have a beer or three in this little bar tucked away between shops. First time I came, it was packed, playing 80's music. Several times since and the bar staff have always been friendly and chatty. Great atmosphere and nice and small.	0
TITLE: Worth visiting | TEXT: We are regular visitors to the resort but had never had a meal at this restaurant before. As we were staying at the accommodation this time, we naturally tried the food.  We were not disappointed. The portions are generous and the quality outstanding.	0
TITLE: Trendy | TEXT: A lovely, lively restaurant that is trendy in food options. Great service (from Julianne) and delicious entree, large plentiful fresh salads and good appetizers.  We enjoyed delicious wine and a drink. So glad we chose this restaurant!	0
TITLE: Amazing Hidden Restaurant...with Excellent Food | TEXT: This food here is amazing.  We loved everything on the menu. We ordered to go here a lot during the pandemic because it was delicious.  However, we had never gone into the actual restaurant until recently. It was an absolute delight. The owner/chef is there to make sure your food is done to perfection. The ambiance is casual/elegant.  It is a true Seattle gem.	0
TITLE: A Magnificent Evening! | TEXT: While we were in town for a quick weekend getaway, we were looking for a solid tasting menu at a place we hadn't tried before. A number of different options presented themselves, and Nomad PDX kept popping up as a place we should take a look at. We decided to go with it and were, obviously, very happy with our decision!  The police is located in a pretty nondescript building that has some really cool space contained within it. You walk in and there's a very casual sitting area with tons of exposed brick, some fun lighting and some very modern looking Decour. It's an interesting mix of classic and modern styles.In doing so, they create a really nice area for people to come in and wind down. The adjacent bar is very cozy, and the dining area - which is literally a long table Just outside the kitchen - creates a very intimate dining experience and atmosphere.  This place apparently started as a pop-up restaurant they got so popular that they decided to open a standalone restaurant. Ryan Fox, the head chef, is doing some really cool stuff here!  There wasn't really a theme to the dinner, other than being delicious.There were a total of eight courses, all of which showed a lot of creativity as well as consideration of the patrons... Mostly because they had three dessert courses!  The variety of foods was pretty awesome, and range from a Peruvian inspired ceviche, to a trout collar serve with flatbread and different butters, to a celery root foam and desserts that included the use of liquid nitrogen (food science is fun!) The trout collar was an absolute hit, as it showcased a really nice portion of the fish that a lot of people don't often pay attention to. Another big hit was a squash soup served with pumpkin bread and chestnut butter. It ends up chestnut butter is awesome!  The favorite dessert was also the signature one. They call it the nest egg, and it is beautiful! Trying to describe and greens does not do this thing justice, but let it be known that this is one of the more beautiful and delicious desserts we've ever experienced!  The measure of a great meal isn’t only the food, but arguably more the entire experience- At the end of the night, we walked away knowing a new group of people who are also big fans of food, and having had a meal that we won't soon forget. If you have an opportunity to go dine at this place, you should absolutely take advantage of it!	0
TITLE: Week long travel with Crow Canyon in Southwest | TEXT: I have travelled with Crow Canyon more than 8 times; mostly in the Southwest. I would label this travel adventure travel.  You are in a small group with at least two scholars, one an archeologist and one a related field.    I have learned so much and had access to so many archeological sites I would not otherwise be allowed to visit.  The trip leaders are full time employees who are very professional and experienced.  These trips are unique learning experiences.  Additionally, I have developed many lasting friendships with other persons I have met on the trips....we all share common interests  which adds to our own experiences.	0
TITLE: Ok I guess | TEXT: Good place,  just wish the tv had a channel guide so we did not have to scroll every channel to find something to watch and we had to get a new key card every time we came back to our room!	1
"TITLE: Miami Cost is Cray Cra | TEXT: Hmm.   All I can say is ""when did everything get so expensive""?      This is not a Michael Schwartz issue,     this is a Miami issue.      Happy to have spent $125 on two dishes of pasta and two glasses of rose for a lunch.     Still wondering---- how did everything get so expensive?"	0
TITLE: Well preserved | TEXT: A nice little building out in the middle of nowhere. It was quite complete with a ground floor and courtyard and a story above that with rooms you could go in. It’s astonishing how old it is and it is one of the best preserved of the desert castles. You can only get there by car, lots of hotels do tours from Amman.	0
TITLE: Stellar dining experience | TEXT: Wonderful vibes the moment we walked in. We were told there was a dining room upstairs, but my wife and I sat at the bar with friends. Although it was a sober night for me, the rest of my group ordered one of the cocktails from the menu that was expertly crafted by a friendly mixologist named Paul. The playlist set the tone for a fun Friday night and the volume was a perfect level for conversation and in seat dancing. This place is a hot spot with folks waiting up to an hour or more to dine at the bar, and frankly, the food is more than worth the wait. It is a culinary delight with high art presentation. It really engaged the five senses, yes even sound; I could hear the crisp of the skin as I bit into the roasted chicken. A rich sensory experience. I have so much more to say about the food, but I invite you to try it out for yourself. We will absolutely be back here.	1
TITLE: This place turns up the HEAT! | TEXT: This place turns up the HEAT! Our group of gals danced the night away! Band was bangin’!!  Servers awesome, food and drinks were on point!  A fabulous Friday night!	0

TITLE: Never again | TEXT: On pulling up to this hotel we could tell it wasn't going to be our perfect holiday. First of all the neon lighting sign was out. As we entered the hotel reception we were greeted by what seemed to be a very miserable hotel manager. After a lot of faffing about with a man that could only speak very little English we finally got to our room. As we arrived late there was some 'fresh food' bought up to us. This wasn't fresh and it seemed to stay in our room for 3 days after we arrived. We decided to have a drink in the bar which I'm pretty sure is a makeshift bar with the bar staff not being able to speak English to the point where we had to pour our own drinks. I won't ramble on to much about how awful this hotel is, but the restaurant was filthy, the rooms were unclean, the pool side was horrendous with empty cups laying everywhere so it was heaven for the flies.  The restaurant which does seem to cater for the Russian guests. We did complain to our rep. The manager offered us an alcarte menu which still would be prepared in the same kitchen which we did ask to view before hand and was very quickly dismissed. If your looking for cheap and cheerful I wouldn't bother wasn't your money because it is far from cheerful!	1
TITLE: Great food! | TEXT: Great home Cookin’ cheese grits amazing, great fried catfish with well seasoned cocktail sauce. Cabbage n beans were just like momma makes. Ty Callie for the great service!	1
TITLE: One of the best in Austin! | TEXT: We have eaten here many times. We always return. Why? Because it is one of the best in Austin. The service is excellent. The food is amazing!! We haven’t found any place here or in the DFW metroplex that compares! You will not be disappointed. Even if something sounds questionable, it is usually the best ever!!	0
TITLE: Good food, good value | TEXT: First time visitors for take out. Wife had the non-spicy grilled salmon salad which came with rice, kimchi and marinated cucumber slices. Quite good. I had the dumpling soup (wantons were super velvety) and steamed Shumai (steamed shrimp dumplings). Both were very good. Can't wait to go back and try the sushi.	1
TITLE: A must go place in San Francisco | TEXT: Very very interesting and creative menu, great wines, good service, nice atmosphere, great place to share plates and try new food combinations, much more interesting than the average restaurant menus	0
TITLE: What a rip off, the worst food and service I have ever had! | TEXT: The server took over one hour to serve us, the food tastes terrible.  The place is dirty and we saw a roach.   The owner happened to be there and offered to serve us himself with this weird salt routine he does that I found creepy, then served my friend directly with his knife a price of burnt meat.  I would never go back, The price was outrageous! They won’t last long, I prefer Capital grill or even la carreta to this dump.	1
TITLE: Perfection | TEXT: Fantastic!  I stopped by this awesome place for lunch after a long morning at the State Capitol.  For lunch, I had the chicken fried mushrooms and vegan cookies.  My lunch was perfection.  Everything was extremely flavorful. I enjoyed my lunch outside and people watched.  Mother is a must.	0
TITLE: Finest Restaurant in Jacksonville, FL | TEXT: This is one of the best Brazilian Steakhouses in the USA. With over 1900 restaurants of all types in the Jacksonville area, they are consistently in the top five. Their array of appetizers, soups, shrimp, salads, cold cuts, prosciutto, cheeses (you name it, they offer it) is spectacular. They also bring out fresh hot rolls (as many as you want) that are made from Yucca flour and cheese. One could make a meal out of these alone. Then comes the non-stop service with steaks, pork, lamb, roast beef, chicken, ribs, etc. that the waiters carve at your table. Everything is fresh, hot, and delicious. Also, their wine list is comprehensive and very fairly priced. Don't miss Terra Gaucha the next time you are in the Jacksonville area.	1
TITLE: One of our favorite spots in Philly! | TEXT: We live 50 miles from Philly. We were going to be in town for a show at the Walnut Street Theatre, celebrating our anniversary. I made reservations at Talula's Garden due to it's proximity to the theater. I believe this was our third or fourth time dining there. I had the Roasted Chicken with Gnocchi and my wife had the Handmade Ricotta Ravioli. To say they were both good would be an understatement. My wife usually never finishes her entree (she did), and it was the absolute best chicken I have ever eaten (anywhere). The only thing that would have made it any better would have been a nice piece of crusty bread to lap up the sauce, as licking the plate would have probably been in bad taste! Outstanding experience from start to finish.	0
TITLE: Skip if possible | TEXT: Just was going to get an order and take it back up to my room no big deal right…..well guess the young lady bartender did not think so.  I was told you’ll have to wait “I only take care of people that are dining or drinking in” as a whole 2 people were at the bar area and no one eating.    The gentleman came out and took my order.  I just got a burger and substituted for a salad.  The food was not bad but I basically got a burger salad.  No separate container for the salad and dressing so everything was just mixed together.	1
TITLE: Terrible experience at expensive and over-hyped restaurant | TEXT: One of our worst dining experiences ever. This fancy speakeasy has no name on the door, just a gold plaque with a rose on it. You have to ring the doorbell when you arrive and a secret panel opens in the door for the host to speak through. I found it on a list of “cozy and romantic” restaurants with great reviews. It is very dark, with bookshelves, and mismatched vintage plates (which fit the décor I guess, but I would have expected something more minimal.   It is very popular and by the time we made a reservation (on a Thursday night), the only available time was 8:45pm. This was already late for our preference, but we thought we’d try it since everyone raved about it. We arrived early at 8:30pm to see if our table was ready. They said it was not, and the people currently seated had just ordered dessert. They recommended we get a drink nearby and they would text us when the table was ready. We waited at our hotel lobby around the corner, thinking it wouldn’t be that long. We received a text at 9:06pm that said “Your table is now ready at Alpen Rose!” When we arrived a few minutes later, we rang the bell again, only for them to tell us it was still NOT ready. There was a rowdy party of 5 guys also at the door that were taken in before us.   It was almost 9:30pm by the time we were seated. Starving, we ordered oysters Rockefeller. Being so late we asked if we could put in our entrée orders but was told that “the chef likes to course it out”. We were surprised by (who we assumed was) a manager bringing us a complimentary appetizer of tuna carpaccio, however I do not eat raw fish. She left with it and came back to ask if we would like shrimp cocktail instead (which my husband is allergic to). We imagine they were trying to make up for being late, but never asked our preference. She finally brought out a wedge salad, like it or not (which was good, even though I don’t eat bacon).   It was very noisy and we were right on top of the people on either side of us – not romantic at all (the space is very small, seating maybe 40 people). The only good thing were the drinks (we had No. 3 and 21). Vegetables and starch sides do not come with the main dish, you must buy them separately (the asparagus was large but tender and tasty). I ordered the branzino, which she said would have some bones but were large and in almost every bite. We were shocked that my husband’s $56 filet was so tough it was hard to cut! Two small dessert bites showed up at the end of the meal, but they did not make up for the poor performance at this price point.   We were seated next to the noisy guys who came before us, so in the end we tried to make the best of it, joking and trading photos with them and being entertained by their drinks covered with smoke, massive Tomahawk cavemen bone steaks, and flaming baked Alaska with a sparkler. Maybe at 50 we are older than the typical crowd, and now we know not to make a reservation that late (especially when the times are not honored), but a pricey establishment like this should know better how to space out their reservations. I would not recommend this restaurant to anyone, even given the hype.	1
TITLE: Cute spot for an early dinner | TEXT: My husband, daughter and I visited for an early dinner. Staff were super friendly and helpful & the food was delicious. We will return!	0
TITLE: Casual and Comfortable | TEXT: I love a spot where I can day drink with a glass of spritz or some equally light and lovely cocktail. This is a comforting neighborhood spot, serving nice sized portions of simple food using very good ingredients (the roasted mushroom omelet is super). Service is attentive without being obnoxious or overbearing and the guests range from families with toddlers to older couples to work colleagues enjoying a break together.  Would happily take anyone there for a good meal and the pleasant atmosphere	0
TITLE: Friendly staff | TEXT: Went in with a group of 8 and waited for about 20 minutes. The staff was friendly and we were served pretty quickly with it being so packed. Everyone got what they ordered and the kids were occupied the whole time in the game room.  Staff was very friendly.	1

TITLE: Special place to eat and drink on Treasure Island | TEXT: Love, love this place for either personal or business. The west-facing restaurant has the prettiest view of downtown San Francisco imaginable. Food is creative but not fancy; reasonable prices, friendly staff. Eat indoors or out. And it's next to the new Treasure Island Park.	0
TITLE: Won't be going back.. | TEXT: Very underwhelming.  The two-hostess standing outside the front door led you to think it will be great service.  Very wrong.  Your seated, and everything is just dropped off, menus, etc.  The food was dropped off and the server just turned and left.  She would rush by the table periodically not bothering to check.  Midway she came rushing by, wearing a black mask and black latex gloves and yelled ALL GOOD?!?! and gave two thumbs up and she rushed buy.  Two hamburgers, two soft drinks (no refills) plus tip was $75...this place has the sound of a death rattle...	1
TITLE: Not good food | TEXT: Fritatta was awful. Staff didn't try to correct situation. My husband's meal was also dissapointing and he was immediately sick and in need of a rest room. We will never go back.	1
TITLE: Fun night out with friends | TEXT: The Point D.C. has lots of potential.  The menu is varied, the location is amazing, and the decor is great.  The service could use some improvement.  Pros -  Menu - lots of great choices, even for those who don't eat seafood Food - came out HOT, which meant it was freshly cooked Decor / ambiance - fantastic Location - right on the water, excellent view Seating - inside or outside seating was available  Cons -  Service - slower than expected Server - was nice, but wasn't attentive	1

TITLE: Won't go back | TEXT: Went for my wife's birthday. The lobster bisque was excellent and that was all. The waitress talked me into getting the whole steamed lobster. The claw tips were tender but the rest tasted uncooked and like rubber. My wife did not like her shrimp and the scallops were not cooked. So much for the Birthday dinner !	1

TITLE: An wonderful experience | TEXT: A wonderful experience. It is very expensive, but you know that before you get there. We had the abridged menu; couldn’t eat a 10 course meal and would not want to pay the much   But the meal was fantastic and the friendliest, most helpful wait service. The wagyu was the best ever.  And the desserts were extremely good and different. If you want an excellent, interesting meal and can afford it, go there.	0
TITLE: HORRIBLE | TEXT: Overpriced, horrible food and customer service.  They make their own hours and open/closed whenever they pleased.	0
TITLE: Fresh, fast and delicious.  Highly recommend for a dependable meal. | TEXT: I first found this restaurant during the worst of the pandemic through Grub Hub.  For delivery it is one of the best I've ever used, but I've also picked up numerous times.  The food is always fresh, the salads are large and delicious, I love the pork ban mi and the broth for the Pho is unique (chicken based).  Very found of the pot stickers as well.    I've tried most of the menu and while I like some more than others based only on my particular taste.    The service is personal and attentive to detail.  I have tried eating in yet, but now that things are open again, I think today might be the day.	1
TITLE: Why I will never go back | TEXT: The lady was rude and non polite to customers and waitresses the cups and silverware were dirty and plates were nasty and they yelled at me because I was getting it grilled and she thought I was finna eat it raw	1

"TITLE: It was fun | TEXT: Menu was varied, local wines & beers. Staff was pleasant and helpful. Food tasted good and plenty of it. There was a short wait on Saturday night, but not terrible. Place was a bit noisy for our tastes, but we are in the ""senior citizen"" category. Not really unusual for a ""sports bar"" atmosphere."	1
TITLE: Decent food but lacks flair | TEXT: Went to Mistral after some friends recommended this restaurant. Menu is nice but the prices are insane. Not that we are “too cheap”, but $98 for lamb is a bit steep. Our appetizers and entree were average in quality but nicely prepared. Our waiter was very good however this place is very busy, loud, and has minimal flair.	1
TITLE: Catering services | TEXT: They provide excellent food for a large group of people and always please everyone.  They have never disappointed us and have been around for years. It is vibrant in the restaurant, and a lot of people enjoy going in to eat. Their food is very delicious!	0
TITLE: Charming staff with a lovely view | TEXT: We had an absolutely lovely dinner here for our first night in Washington. It was a birthday trip for my dad, and the staff were so welcoming. Even the manager came over to wish him well, he was a gentleman and we enjoyed chatting to him while enjoying the view.   We were surprised it wasn’t busier but sounds like a lot of people don’t know it’s there, so highly recommend as the only thing that would have been better is more people for the atmosphere!	0
TITLE: Pier 39 Pier Market | TEXT: Delicious sea food if you like sea food you must try here. Very kind waitress, clean, and good price. You can share a plate	0
TITLE: Excellent | TEXT: The restaurant is exceptional from the decoration, atmosphere, service and food.  However the only thing we didn't like was that our waiter made us place the complete order.  We wanted to order the appetizers and first couse and then wait to see if we want it to have a second course.	1
TITLE: Reminiscing | TEXT: I was stationed in Berlin in the 80's and this was my favorite watering hole. At the time it was called the Old Dublin ran by a great friend named Klaus. Sorry to hear it's closed. One of the things I loved was the shelf above the bar had coins from all over the world plastered on with Guinness foam, never believed it til a buddy stuck a 5 mark piece up there! A little slice of the old world, apparently gone forever. I had to put a date, my last visit was actually in 1989.	0
TITLE: Go! You won’t be disappointed! | TEXT: We had heard about this place recently and had to check it out. We were not disappointed. The food was exceptional and the service outstanding. Love the homey vibe of the place and the decor.	0

The beet salad was an excellent starter, as was the boiled eggs over mayo.  We had the charcuterie, the croq madame, and a really good soup, and some goat cheese beignets.  Outstanding food and service.	0

TITLE: I love the feeling of welcomeness | TEXT: Man awesome employees here and surprisingly young employees and so patient and respectful here. Absolutely loved how fast the drive threw was to. All around 100 stars!	1
TITLE: Lunch disaster | TEXT: Stopped for lunch for our Anniversary. The inside appears clean and pleasant so that was nice. Very few patrons so we figured we would get our order in quickly and be served right away. Boy were we wrong.  Our server was pleasant but not very knowledgeable of any of the dishes. Our order took 25 minutes to be served and it was extremely overcooked. Burned even. I had the chicken parm meal. It was burned and the pasta had zero flavor. Just an awful dish all around. Ordered cannolis for desert and those were equally awful.  Adequate service but the food was well below sub par. I hope I don’t have to eat here again	1
TITLE: This restaurant has slipped. | TEXT: This restaurant has slipped since the last time we visited. Both food and service leave much to be desired. Two different steaks were still quite good, but a Caesar salad on the menu with Little Gem lettuce was ordinary romaine and in two “cut it yourself” slabs. Service was lackadaisical, wave and wave to get your server, drinks wrong, wrong steak sauce. Large slice of roast beef looked nice, but why swimming in a deep pool of beef broth? That is not “au jus”. The Japanese fries are just OK, most steak places have better, crispier, or matchstick, etc. “Loaded” baked potato was certainly that, if you are into a thousand calorie smothered vegetable. Curiously meager wine list with few cabs, the preferred steak wine of many people. So all and all if you’re looking for a NY or Las Vegas steakhouse experience, this is not even close.	1
TITLE: Better than ever | TEXT: Absolutely the best, hands down…never disappoints… the staff are even better than the food and that’s saying quite a lot! Ginou and Victor are so wonderful, warm, & kind and made us feel like royalty…it’s the one place you shouldn’t miss for a special time in Miami	0

"TITLE: defamation of character | TEXT: I came into station 16 today as I always do because this is one of my favorite restaurants to visit. My alcoholic beverage was watery and I sent it back. general manager RJ ( who refused to give me his real name who was rude) start talking stuff stating every time I come in here it's an issue and the last time I had an issue with the server. Mind you he was the server I complained about before he became general manager because when he was a server he had the same nasty attitude and I complained to his manager at the time and I'm sorry if a server is being rude to me im going to let upper management know that is my right and if my food comes out not good or cold as a PAYING customer I have a right to have them remake it never was rude always respectful. The fact that he stated this false accusation in front of other customers and staff badgering my character (that's defamation of character which my friend I was with recorded this) he made me feel so humiliated, uncomfortable and he embarrassed me! When I asked to speak with the chain of command he refused and stated with a smart gesture and said ""he's the general manager and he's the last of the chain of command and if the owners want to call me they will and that's if the owner feels like calling me"" and he will let them know it's always an issue which is very much false and I feel he's making this up to cover up his wrong doing and to retaliate against me for when I complained on him. Not only did he humiliated me but defamation of character, I will be taken this further more legally. The disrespect and attitude was uncalled for and very unprofessional and I will be taken actions all the way. Mind you I haven't been here in months because I had kidney surgery (life threatening) and was fighting for my life and came out to celebrate life and this how I'm treated. Run back the cameras and you will see how I was treated and how he humiliated me in front  of staff and customers because he wanted to retaliate. By him being a general manager he should of conducted hisself way better and professionally. He is in place to defuse any issues not make them worst and not to be rude or retaliate against me because he was complained on and now taken this personal. He approached my table with the smart remarks and my friend had me asked him again what he said so we can get it on recording and he did."	1
TITLE: Museum and House Tour Make this a fun Visit | TEXT: A visit to this presidential library comprises three potential activities.  First, there is an hour long tour of his house.  Second, the main building includes a small exhibition of his time as President.  Lastly, a mile from the library is his memorial.  We spent just under two hours here.	0
TITLE: Avoid here at All Costs | TEXT: This McDonald's is One of the Worst Ones I have Been to Yet. I Ordered online before I left My Hotel, and 10 Minutes after I left, I Arrived. But I had to Wait 58 Minutes before They Finally Told Us we Needed to Ask for our Order. This Stupid McDonald's did not say when your order was ready, you had to Ask for it. This Took up 50 minutes of my time. 1 Star, Never Coming to this One Again.	1
TITLE: Best Chain Wing Restaurant | TEXT: Always satisfied with the wings!! Always fresh, never dry, and plenty of sauce!! Custom service is also a 5 star.	1
TITLE: Service was Off | TEXT: We have been longtime fans of Orsay and make it a regular stop when driving in from Hilton Head. They offer an extensive vegetarian menu and probably the best hamburger in the area according to my husband. The weekend brunch is really fine and happy hour runs all day on Saturday (11am to 6pm) with 1/2 price wines by the glass and bottle. Staff is friendly and knowledgeable m- they are normally quite attentive. This visit was a bit different. While my husband’s burger was perfectly prepared, his request for Dijon mustard went unfulfilled for more than 10 minutes and required requests to three separate servers before the condiment arrived. Our server provided a complimentary sparkling wine, a nice gesture but too little too late. His meal had cooled and I was well into my lunch by then. Very disappointing. We will eat here again. Do look at the petit desserts-for a small price you get a sample of one (or more) of their delicious sweet treats….I can attest to the crepe brûlée!	1
TITLE: Lounge Has It All | TEXT: Nicely crafted and creative drinks, delicious food served up in a historic and beautiful setting, with stellar views over the city. I enjoyed their cheeseburger as well as several other items during our stay at the Bellevue; all were excellent. They offer a sweet happy hour which includes some drinks and some food. The service is impeccable, but also very welcoming and friendly. I enjoyed the drinks, food and ambience so much, I kept going back; it was that great.	0
TITLE: Crowded, super noisy and garlicky | TEXT: They pack the restaurant with so many people one can hardly breathe in there. Food is very good but terribly garlicky. They also charge a lot for each mini plate they offer… using the tapas system they get you into ordering many overpriced small garlic bombs. All in all we do not go back although we live nearby as the hassle of being jammed into the noise restaurant is not worth the food.	1
TITLE: Disappointing special occasion | TEXT: Firstly the food was excellent. We had the set menu Steak Tartare and Striploin (fatty but to be expected) and Sticky Toffee Pudding. We thoroughly enjoyed the food, there was a nice busy ambience and feel to the restaurant. We were close enough to a window to have a view of the park. Visiting from England and Abu Dhabi we were celebrating my daughters 21st birthday. Every other place we have been to in New York have acknowledged this and we have loved the welcoming feel. The Bluebird dinner was the real big event for us and we were soo disappointed with the service. We were greeted with a ‘Yes’ I almost wanted to apologise for being there. The maitre d walked away without speaking to us - we kind of figured we should follow! Most restaurants begin with a Good Evening and Welcome at the very least. A waiter asked if we wanted water (we later noticed everyone else having tap water) and swiftly brought a bottle of still. No smile, no niceties, no welcome. Next our server came to us, perfectly amicable and perfunctory but no introduction or welcome. We ordered our food and drinks. Food came very quickly as starters were both cold. I asked a waiter if we could have our drinks, he explained they were busy. I explained this was a special occasion and so far it had been less than special. To his credit a few minutes later the drinks appeared. We received our steaks and the manger noted we had no steak knives, which she quickly corrected. Mains cleared and deserts promptly brought out. When we had finished our desert our server asked if we wanted anything or just the check! By this time I was totally incensed. Let alone feel this was a special occasion, we were now feeling an inconvenience and she just wanted us to leave. 250 dollars for 2 - I at least expect to feel welcome. Perhaps I am wrong to expect a little more personalised attention at a restaurant of this standard. Clearly it is just a get them in and out and take their money business model. I did not leave a tip and funnily enough no one asked me if everything was ok for me to put my thoughts across at the end of the evening. A shame that such a special occasion will be tainted by a lack of attention and personal experience.	1
TITLE: Great experience and a must-see place if in Dallas! | TEXT: Great food, ambience and service! It was the first time I visited and would highly recommend if you are on business or pleasure.	0
TITLE: Delicious food served cold…. | TEXT: Fare is a cool restaurant with some pretty awesome food.  Only problem is that I’ve been there twice and both times my entrée was served cold.  I just don’t understand how a restaurant could do that.  Don’t they have a person to ensure meals are hot and immediately served when prepared?  Fix that, and you get a 5 from me!	1
TITLE: Best lunch meeting ever! | TEXT: I finally asked the host of our monthly meeting, where they get the lunch.  It is always super fresh and delicious.  Today I chose a Greek vegetable and hummus sandwich(gyro).  Being a meat lover, I was a little apprehensive, but it was awesome. The flavors were blended perfectly. Only open for breakfast and lunch, so go early.  Looking forward to taking my wife.  She is a big hummus fan and is going to love it.	1

TITLE: DIRTY ROACH CRAWLING | TEXT: WENT TO THE BAKERY MIDDAY. TABLES WERE DIRTY AND STICKY. MANAGER THAT DAY WAS A SHORT HAIRED BLONDE LADY TOTALLY OBLIVIOUS TO REGULAR CUSTOMERS SKIPPING IN LINE NOT GETTING A # AND FOLLOWING THE PROTOCOL ESTABLISHED BY THE RESTAURANT, MAKING OUR WAIT LONG. THE PASTRY CASEMENT LOOKS DIRTY AS WELL. WHEN WE FINALLY SAT DOWN AFTER WIPING DOWN OUR TABLE WHICH THE MANAGER SAW US DO AND DID NOT EVEN APOLOGIZE FOR THE FILTHYNESS, WE SEE A GIGANTIC ROACH CRAWLING ON THE WALL. WE THREW OUR FOOD AND LEFT THE ROACH CRAWLING ON THE WALL FOR THE NEXT PATRON. GROSS!	1
TITLE: [no title] | TEXT: This lovely restaurant welcomed us with a big friendly smile and as we were shown to our table there was a beautiful hand drawn card .. made by one of the servers ,( wish I could remember her name ) with silver stars sprinkled on our table . What a welcome !!! Myself and Grandaughter   ( from the UK ) were visiting my son who is currently living and working in Boston and it was our first time in the beautiful city . He booked it as a special evening and it certainly was . The  bread basket with whipped butter was delicious … The Calamari starter was huge and so glad we shared it , my salmon and asparagus risotto was cooked perfectly.  My Grandaughter had spaghetti with clams ..first time she has had this and said it was amazing ,   my son had the a 16 oz steak .. we were so full but  I desperately wanted to try the key lime pie so we shared one portion and so glad we did , schamazing !!! as it’s so popular we got almost the last one .. it is homemade by one of the bar staff .. who makes 3 of the deserts on the menu .. it is  truly divine … we had an amazing experience there all due to the the Manager and the wonderful  server Julie .. Julie has been there 25 years and a truly outstanding waitress , they do really look after you and made our special trip to Boston  a truly memorable one.

TITLE: World Traver favorite vacation | TEXT: I expected the scenery and the sites to be amazing, but was not prepared for the professionalism and passion of the staff!  Without exception all staff members engaged with participants to educate and make feel welcome!	0
TITLE: A real gem of a place! | TEXT: How is it possible that a restaurant of this calibre has a handful of reviews!!!   This is an amazingly beautiful restaurant with incredibly attentive staff and their food is to die for. Honestly by far the best restaurant experience (of this type) of our Texas trip and we will definitely make the point of returning here if we ever come back.	0
TITLE: Harding Presidential Sites | TEXT: We had a great visit to the Warren G Harding Presidential Library and Memorial. The Library (aka Museum) is quite small compared to other presidential libraries, but does a good job telling the story of Harding's short presidency. Tours of his home are only offered on the hour, so we had to miss that, but did take photos from the outside. We also visited the Harding Memorial in the cemetery, which was quite impressive. If you're passing by Marion, Ohio, take a break from your drive and stop by to see the presidential sites.	0

TITLE: Good Neighborhoody Southern Buffet | TEXT: The food was decent and the service staff was kind.  There's a lot of variety, it is a true southern buffet.  They even had chicken livers and gizzards!  I ate the fried chicken (good), the fried catfish (very good), and the mashed potatoes (not much flavor).  For dessert, I had some bread pudding and peach cobber which were both okay.  The salad wasn't that fresh though the sides were very good.    I'd eat here again if I'm in town.  I was especially pleased that they'd opened at 10 AM with the hotel checkout being 11.	1
TITLE: Found this while passing thru town | TEXT: Just a slight detour from our route and it was well worth it. Seems to be a very popular local place. My wife and I both ordered paninis. Hers was Italian and mine Southwest. Both were excellent. I, also, really enjoyed their cole slaw. Service was fast and efficient. They do have a full bar, as well. Great little place, especially if you're traveling and want something other than fast food.	0
TITLE: Amazing staff! | TEXT: We met with a friend to enjoy some bites at Odd Duck, happily surprised that valet parking is free (tip-based). Our waiter was beyond accommodating to our needs. When my fiancé told her his dietary needs, she returned with the seasonal menu marked up to help him know exactly what to order—wow! We sat in the enclosed porch space and it wasn't too loud or cold. Our meal was great and the staff is exceptional.	1
TITLE: Amazing | TEXT: Amazing dinner. Definitely need reservations. Need to start early to get them as well. It is a set menu that will be $90. Very inventive with interesting combinations of flavors. Hummus was some of the best ever! Dessert really blew our socks off with the fennel sorbet and the carrot cake. Wow. Just wow. Takes about 2-3 hours to dine.	1
TITLE: Big, comfortable and cheap. | TEXT: I really liked this hotel. The room was HU-GE. Two big single beds, a desk, wardrobe, huge TV, and big bathroom. Very clean and cheap. I recommend it definitely. Service at the front desk was great too. It is not a 5-star so don't expect luxuries, but for a 2 star it's very good.	1
TITLE: Don’t forget dessert! | TEXT: This quaint French bar was highly recommended by the wine merchant at Western and Pike Wine Shop and we are so glad he did!  The place is busy with a few tables outdoors, inside and at the bar. My husband enjoyed the falafel with salad and found it totally satisfying. I ordered the red pepper soup…it was delicious with just the right amount of kick. Table service included a chewy baguette with butter. We treated ourselves to the chocolate mousse for dessert-WOW!  Velvety dark chocolate mousse served along side a portion of perfectly whipped heavy cream. A single order is large enough to serve 2-4. Great wines to choose from. This is a great break in the day for a delicious meal.	1
TITLE: Will be back!! | TEXT: Super super friendly service by the owner.  I felt so welcomed. The lunch I had - a pork banh mi - was a new flavor profile for me and really delicious and affordable. So many things on the menu I want to try - I’ll be back.	1
TITLE: Average | TEXT: The food here wasn't great. It's by the kilo but, overall average. I also have seafood allergies and it was clear that although I stayed far away from the seafood it must have been cooked in the same pan or handled with the same utensils because by the time I left I was a walking rash.	1

TITLE: Customer service A+ | TEXT: Came for Sunday brunch and to hear live music. Was not disappointed in any way. The food was delicious, my favorite was shrimp and grits, candied yams, so good, and the customer service was on point. We sat at the bar ( place was crowed and I can see why :) ) and the bartender Stacy, was very pleasant, drinks were just right. Want to thank Yvette, the manger, for taking the time to ensure our time there was special, she was very friendly and attentive and we truly appreciated, we had such a good time.	0
TITLE: Worst Ever | TEXT: This was the worst McDonalds ever. Long lines, long waits, cold food and terrible service. Long lines and waits were due to the most disorganized and useless crew working. This place needs to fire everyone and do some training in management and service. Don't do it and find somewhere else to eat.	1
TITLE: If you love extreme noise and a rude waiter, this is a place for you | TEXT: If you love, extreme noise, extremely loud music, and very tight seating arrangements, this might be the very place for you. Furthermore, if you’d love to be contradicted by a waiter in a most rude manner, this might also be perfect for you. The food was fine, small portions, big prices, but tapas restaurants seem to be like that anyway. That is not the point. When I asked for pulpo asado (octopus) they brought fried breaded calamari. Even an elementary school kid the difference between squid and octopus. The extremely rude waiter contradicted me when I mentioned that this was not octopus, it was calamari. Octopi do not have rings!! Squid have rings and octopi have tentacles with suction cups. It was so obvious to the point of pathetic that it was funny how the man was dead set on contradicting us and in the most rude fashion. If I were the manager, which we did not contact because we didn’t want to make a scene, this guy would have been in the street right away. When I confronted him and asked him why we got calamari instead of octopus, he said “the chef knows what he’s doing thank you” and he left the table in a huff. Obviously we are not coming back nor our large groups of friends.	1
TITLE: Tried again, same result | TEXT: I understand the job market, but one waitress for the whole restaurant ?  Just don’t.  Host/manager should have been helping on every table.  Food is meh at best, hash browns were cold mushy sticks.  French toast without syrup, dry af.  Eggs Benedict dry af.  No jam for toast wtf.  One bread opy, really.??	1
TITLE: The worst experience | TEXT: .This has been the only bad experience I’ve had so far, even though I’ve visited many places. The level of disregard and poor treatment was extremely high. I do not recommend this place. Terrible customer service from the moment you walk in	0
TITLE: Exceptional Experience | TEXT: This was my second time at Friday Saturday Sunday.  It's definitely a restaurant for a special occasion!  The tasting menu is pricey but in my opinion well worth it.  I experienced eight courses of unique and delicious dishes, each served by amazing servers who could explain the intricacies of the dishes so well.  Although this is definitely a high end restaurant, it never feels stuffy or pretentious.  I dined alone and was made to feel comfortable and as special as if I was with an important group.  Starting with the seasonal snacks to the halibut dish, pasta, and steak, each dish was immaculately prepared and served.  Dessert was an amazing chocolate cake, a vanilla type custard/ice cream, and an extra chocolate coated piece of heaven!  I did not choose the optional wine pairing, but instead enjoyed one of their cocktails, an Orange Catholic.  They are known for their cocktails as well and this one was amazing!	1
TITLE: Bad mussels ruin experience! | TEXT: This restaurant is in a beautiful area of SF!!!  Gorgeous old homes and buildings!  Amazing!!!    The service was very good and we loved that it is a tip free restaurant.  Awesome that they provide a great work environment for their employees.    The portions were huge!  Especially the pork chops!!!!  Also the cheese from the selection of 3 cheeses appetizers,  2 of the 3 were huge chunks of cheese.    Most of our food was amazing and very delicious.  But my sister and I had the PEI mussels that were very off and made me almost throw up.  We couldn’t eat them.  We told our waiter at the end of our meal, as he asked how the food was.  He told the cook and the cook said they were fresh, bought that day and tasted fine.  Too bad for us!  Charged full price .  Not that we were expecting them to remove the charge but since neither of us could eat them we would have thought there would have been more than a “too bad!”  It left our experience less that delightful.	1
TITLE: Open on Mondays, good fortune! | TEXT: Not much open on Mondays so we were glad Good Fortune wasn’t closed. We decided on an Indonesian Rijsttafel for 2. Lots of food and it all tasted good. Some of the little dishes were not as Indonesian as I had hoped more Chinese cuisine influenced. Over all the dinner was good and plentiful. Not too pricey either. Service was very friendly.	0
TITLE: Modern Italian | TEXT: Torno Subito delivers a truly creative dining experience, with dishes that showcase high quality, sustainability, and outstanding presentation. You can clearly see Massimo Bottura’s influence in the innovative approach to traditional Italian flavors.  The portions are a bit small, which might leave some wanting more, but the attention to detail in every bite makes up for it.  The neighborhood is rough and still developing—it feels unsafe at night. Hopefully, things will improve soon.  One suggestion: the staff should speak more Italian. Some try, but it’s minimal. A stronger Italian presence would enhance the authenticity of the experience.  Expensive.	1
TITLE: Stick to the ribs brunch but inconsistent | TEXT: Came here for weekend brunch.  Right in the heart of east passyunk, it’s a popular place. Its theme is Amish influence which is nice for brunch.  On the one hand. My Amish bologna eggs Benedict with cream chip beef and was super yummy and our lattes were perfect.  But my wife’s Avacado toast was really too basic for the price.  Also the service felt young and untrained and very inconsistent.  So we drop a star for that inconsistency.	1
TITLE: The ultimate Italian experience, La Cena! | TEXT: La Cena is the perfect place for the ultimate Italian experience in food and wine! We had a “cousins” dinner in February and are returning this evening. I decided to write a review after reading in disbelief the small number of critical reviews. Our experience was amazing! The ambiance, decor, menu, and wine offerings equal or surpass the best you can find in Italy. Every one of us shared and were so impressed with our food selections and our server suggested perfect wines to accompany our choices. Everything was delicious and prepared perfectly. It’s difficult to find enough superlatives to describe La Cena! I highly recommend!	0

TITLE: Dinner in Philadelphia, PA | TEXT: Came here for dinner Saturday night—had reservations so we were seated right away.  Cute small restaurant.  The bar area seems pretty energetic but we sat in the dining area.  Started off with Half Dozen Pink Moon Raw Oysters—so delicious!  Also tried the Roasted Oysters which were overloaded with breadcrumbs I could barely taste the oyster underneath—also has a spicy kick to it as well!  For entrees, we tried to Bucatini Cacio E Pepe and Mafaldine Alla Vodka—both pasta dishes were generous portions and overall were pretty good!  No issues with our cocktails and service was great.	1

TITLE: Neat find!  Good food. | TEXT: This was a neat find.  There is indoor and outdoor seating.  We sat outside & the server pulled up a heater for us when it started to get a little chilly. We ordered Cordon Bleu, & Schnitzel.  The Cordon Bleu was delicious!  The side I ordered was Spatzle & it was a little dry. There are a ton of combinations that you can customize your entrée with. We also ordered a pretzel for an appetizer, and a Bee Sting for dessert.  Both were good.	1
TITLE: A decent steakhouse with a decent vibe | TEXT: Alright, so we went on a Friday night and had a res for 8:15. Valet was easy. The hosting staff was amazing and gave us recommendations and were super friendly. We waited about 15 minutes to be sat because she said she wanted us in the main dining room after we told her our monthly steakhouse review plans. Sweet girl. We talked with them almost the whole wait. The decor was cool, including a giant fish tank and car in the dining room. The atmosphere was loud and vibrant with a cool guy swagger. Our server was exceptional and made some suggestions as well. We ordered the filet mignon, cheeseburger and fries, (one of the recommendations by hostess), mac and cheese, fried brussel sprouts, and passion fruit kickers. Okay, so they cook their steaks over some cedar wood and I just wasn't the biggest fan as it tasted smokey and almost bbq'd and I guess I'm a bit of a traditionalist when it comes to steak. It was cooked perfectly but I had a hard time getting past the woodsy flavor. The voodoo sauce they served with it was SLAPPIN. Request it if you go. They told us the cheeseburger and fries were better than Hudson House. Nope, as it was really, really salty and you could feel the salt crystals in your mouth. The mac and cheese was okay but mine is better and the brussel sprouts were the star of the show with a tangy honey mustard flavor that we both looooved. We didn't do dessert, which is a travesty, but nothing really spoke to us. No tears overall (yes, I sometimes cry when i eat really good food). The meal was $150 and we left $60 for tip and $5 for valet for a total of $215. Food: 5/10 Ambience: 8/10 Service: 10/10 Next up is Pappas Brothers for anyone who cares, but I'm excited and this is fun. Much love.	1

TITLE: Day in Philly | TEXT: Interesting little place in the heart of South Philly. we went with several very different items, The Veggie Dutch, the Lebanese Salami and cream chesse omelet, and the truffle mushroom omelet.  All was good and different and will come back to try the great looking pancakes! Service was a little slow as it is a small place and two front staff members. The bar out front takes a lot of space , if it was nice out, we would have sat in the outside space out front.	1
TITLE: Wooden beamed authentic pub near Boston Common | TEXT: Great atmosphere with low wood beamed ceilings creating an olde world pub feel. Lots of great beers on tap. Food is good pub grub. Not a lot of gluten free options but the loaded nachos were delicious. Our server suggested a half portion: great call!! It was huge!!	1
"TITLE: Skip the Dinner and Just have Dessert and Coffee | TEXT: Sister and I went for dinner.  She ordered veal and I ordered the scallop and pasta special.  Her veal and potatoes were very good but the ""vegetable medley"" was a pile of mushy vegs. The best thing that could be said about my dish were the two blistered cherry tomatoes were tasty.  The bead size scallops were rubbery, the small amt of sauce was incredibly bland, and the dish was dry. The side garden salads were very nice size, fresh and good.  The salted caramel cheesecake was amazing and strangely enough, the decaf coffee  was truly terrific.  However, a $97 meal (we ordered no alcohol) with mushy vegetables and a non-edible entree was a big disappointment.  The reason I did not send back my entree was that it took 45 minutes for our meal to arrive.  There were 3 servers and 9 tables, so that was not the issue."	1
TITLE: Small restaurant, but BIG on taste/dining experience... | TEXT: Was in Philly visiting my son and he said we couldn't leave without eating at Bistro Southeast.  He discovered this restaurant last year when he moved to the area.  He said he'd never been disappointed and we weren't either!  The food was so fresh and the service was excellent.  I ordered the salt and pepper shrimp, my son ordered the spicy curry shrimp, my daughter ordered summer rolls and the rice bowl with chicken; we also ordered thai sweet chili wings and sweet potato fries to share.  All very delicious!!!  If visiting Philly, be sure to stop by this jewel of a restaurant.	1
TITLE: Definitely recommend | TEXT: Stop here when visiting Philly. Large variety of foods to choose from. Plenty of shop to look for souvenirs. Definitely with visiting especially if it’s your first time visiting.	0
TITLE: Customer service at its best! | TEXT: Truly a historic gem (circa 1925) restored to modern day convenience. Good amenities in a great location.   Perhaps the best part was my experience at breakfast this morning. The standard Holiday Inn Express offerings were very well prepared (e.g., perfectly moist and appealing scrambled eggs) and the attendants distinguished themselves by their continuous checks and attention to detail like wiping up spills. However, the MOST REMARKABLE service I witnessed was when one of the two attendants noticed a guest (walking with a cane) needing assistance as he served his plate from the buffet. She respectfully approached him and offered her help. It was spontaneous kindness and true customer service at its best!  Both my day and my trip were made better by seeing the above (while also enjoying a tasty, filling breakfast)!  I will be back!	1
TITLE: Unstuffy culinary hotspot | TEXT: We came here for dinner while visiting friends who live in the area, and had a wonderful meal!  The ambiance is upscale and trendy without being stuffy, and it was very clear that this is a culinary hotspot. The staff were professional and friendly - our waitress was very helpful when we were struggling to decide what to order. The crispy duck, salmon satay, tempura cauliflower, and the general tso soup were outstanding! We ended up not leaving anything for leftovers, which doesn't generally happen with us. We'll definitely come back the next time we're in town.	0
TITLE: Stylish Ambiance, Top-Notch Service & Amazing Pizza! | TEXT: Paradiso in Bishop Arts District is a fantastic spot! The decor and ambiance are incredibly fancy, creating a chic yet welcoming atmosphere. But beyond the beautiful setting, the service is truly professional, and the food is high quality. Every dish was well-prepared and flavorful, making for a great dining experience. A special mention goes to the pizzas—they were perfectly cooked, with a crispy crust and delicious toppings. Whether you’re looking for a stylish night out or just great food, this place is definitely worth a visit!	0
TITLE: Unstuffy culinary hotspot | TEXT: We came here for dinner while visiting friends who live in the area, and had a wonderful meal!  The ambiance is upscale and trendy without being stuffy, and it was very clear that this is a culinary hotspot. The staff were professional and friendly - our waitress was very helpful when we were struggling to decide what to order. The crispy duck, salmon satay, tempura cauliflower, and the general tso soup were outstanding! We ended up not leaving anything for leftovers, which doesn't generally happen with us. We'll definitely come back the next time we're in town.	0
TITLE: Nice place to eat off the beaten path | TEXT: We arrived at the restaurant after 9pm (it closes at 10pm). We had a nice seat outside and a very friendly/good server named, Carlos.   We had a Cesar salad with salmon and the baby gems salad with shrimp added.  They were both really good!  It was a nice, easy and enjoyable experience.	0
TITLE: Everything delicious | TEXT: Recommended by the Courtyard by Marriott front desk, I had a nearly perfect sumptuous dinner at Market Tavern.  Loved the choices of by the glass wines.  My Duckhorn Merlot was delicious!  Was in the mood for steak, and the kitchen totally delivered.    I decided to eat in the bar as a solo, and they had good sports choices on multiple TVs. The bar was doing a fine business.  Portions are very generous.  My ribeye steak was perfectly cooked medium rare, exceptionally tasty, and a perfect accompaniment to the wine.  It came with two side dishes, great steamed broccoli and garlic mashed potatoes.  Amazing flavors!  Again all portions were huge!  Highly recommend this restaurant and so pleased to experience it during my one, and possibly only, visit to Stockton.	1
TITLE: Good food and excellent server | TEXT: Hot and delicious food. Excellent server—Sam Decent-sized booth Music TOO Loud Bathrooms need cleaning and attention.	1
TITLE: Not very good patio closes early | TEXT: Patio closes at 6 pm why so early nice outside it's a beautiful evening July 9 th 2025 5:09 pm patio closed at 6 pm young man said sorry closing patio. I said you close at 9:30pm why does patio close so early doesn't get dark til 8 pm I'm a business owner and this is unprofessional. shortsalesmit@gmail.com Frances Bazan	1
TITLE: Clearly recommended | TEXT: Whilst the ambiance is not the best - a bit too busy and acoustically unfavourable) I clearly recommend to go as the food is extra tasty, the service perfect and relaxed-friendly at the same time.	1
TITLE: Farm to Table Excellence | TEXT: Perhaps the best meal I had in Philadelphia. Very large restaurant with big patio and several inside dining areas plus a large bar. Well appointed and elegant but still warm and welcoming atmosphere. We enjoyed a meal of roasted cauliflower with coconut curry, garbanzo beans and quinoa. Along with lamb bolognese Pappardelle with whipped ricotta. Their chive and cheddar biscuits are to die for.  Wine options are well chosen and multiple by the glass offerings	0
TITLE: Very Noisy | TEXT: Much too noisy. I enjoy loud restaurants but I feel the “cackling”  group at the adjacent table ruined our evening even though the food, wine and service was exceptional.  We wish management ask the five ladies next to us  to simply respect the other patrons and quiet down!	1
TITLE: Great!! | TEXT: Colin was great. Cheesecake and affogato perfect ending to a good meal! The veal was great and the filet has great flavor. Colin was friendly  and made us laugh!	0
TITLE: Hungry Men | TEXT: So another business trip..  So we have to eat!!!!  This the best..we always go here. Wish the Country was run like this place!  We love the owner. A no nonsense get it done lady!	0
TITLE: Harding Presidential Sites | TEXT: We had a great visit to the Warren G Harding Presidential Library and Memorial. The Library (aka Museum) is quite small compared to other presidential libraries, but does a good job telling the story of Harding's short presidency. Tours of his home are only offered on the hour, so we had to miss that, but did take photos from the outside. We also visited the Harding Memorial in the cemetery, which was quite impressive. If you're passing by Marion, Ohio, take a break from your drive and stop by to see the presidential sites.	0
TITLE: We watched a short film at the museum prior to the tour | TEXT: Our guide was Theodore, he did an excellent job sharing his knowledge of Warren Harding and Florence- marriage, campaign and presidency. The tour started on the porch where his Porch Campaign took place. The house furnishings are over 90% original. NO Pictures allowed which is sad for my personal journey ablum. The museum has nice exhibits with a couple audios. Enjoyed watching the pictures taken on the Voyage of Understanding tour to the western states and Alaska. Purchase tickets on-line because we were shocked how the first 3 tours were fully booked. We changed our itinerary to make a late afternoon tour. Large parking lot. Restrooms on site.	1
TITLE: It was walking into a ToysRus store | TEXT: I had read many reviews online and asked staff at my hotel all the food market. It was a 10-15 walk from my hotel and walking to the Reading Terminal Market was like walking into a toy store and not knowing what toy you want buy first.  There was so much  choices  of food available.  After walking round the market for around 10 minutes looking to see what I fancied I eventually chose a vender and had my first Philly cheesesteak.  Delicious, will defo go back again before I leave. Must do place for a visit.	0
TITLE: Delicious food in special occasion setting. | TEXT: A perfect special occasion place. Great food with lovely presentation. I had duck with parsnip puree, apples, and fois gras pudding. Fabulous. Cooked as ordered, and the right size portion. Pre-entree arugula salad was eh, but hot potato leek soup with fried puffed noodle was delicious. Dessert was a white chocolate soufflé with pistachio crème and was wonderful: creamy, the right amount of egginess, not too sweet yet smooth and unctuous. My husband had the scallops, which he said were the best he has ever had, cooked perfectly, sweet and tender. He also ordered the wagu beef appetizer, which we all tried: raw but seared on a hot stone and served with soy, pickles and wasabi. Meat was very thinly sliced and tender but nothing to write home about despite the very substantial price. Daughter ordered the homemade pasta bolognese, which was yummy. Servers come to the table with a variety of breads, including ciabatta and focaccia. I tried both, and felt they were just good, but my daughter and son love the focaccia.  They offer several special cocktails. I asked for a chocolate martini ( their special was espresso martini) and it was very good.  Mathew’s is a small, attractive place where you don’t have to shout to have a conversation. Exemplary service from our waiter and his several assistants. Free valet parking out front. Small but well appointed bar when you walk in. Upscale but not stuffy.	1
TITLE: Dinner after work | TEXT: Great steaks and nice atmosphere. The bartender was nice as I sat at the bar and talked about Portland with the person who had just arrived. Would recommend for a special dinner or event as the restaurant is really nice. Oh yeah, good wine selection as well.	0
TITLE: Pleasant place for drinks and dessert | TEXT: During our stay, we stopped by the XIX lounge for drinks and dessert.  My wife and I were each treated to a generous pour of a good chardonnay, which had just a bit of residual sweetness.  We also shared a portion of the chocolate mousse, which was very satisfying.  Prices are a little on the high side, but that's to be expected when you're in a classy location like the Bellevue.	0

TITLE: Very good Southern cooking | TEXT: Ellen’s provides very good Southern style dishes from their flagship location in the West End area of Dallas.  We came here on a Tuesday for lunch and were immediately seated.  We ordered chicken fried steak with mashed potatoes and green beans.  The steak was great, the mashed potatoes were slightly bland but the green beans were excellent, mingled with tomatoes and bacon.   A by the glass Cabernet rounded off lunch.	1
TITLE: Alarming | TEXT: This is the first restaurant to serve lab grown salmon.  It's called Wildlife .    They call it cultivated salmon .    I didn't order it so not sure how it tastes.	0
TITLE: Lunch with a Dear Friend | TEXT: My friend chose this place for us to meet for lunch.  I loved the Teriyaki Salmon dish I ordered.  The atmosphere was great, too!	0
TITLE: Incredible Dining experience | TEXT: My son who lives in Dallas had been bragging on this restaurant. We had reservations but still had a 20 minute wait to our table. The manager gave us an app on the house. The food was fabulous. Service was spot on.	1
TITLE: Wonderful experience with a large group | TEXT: We found this spot for a group of 20+ last minute on a busy weekend and they fit us in at a beautiful table and it was a wonderful experience.  The food was incredible but the service even better. They assigned us enough servers to make sure we were taken care of very well. The atmosphere was great, bathrooms clean...just a very well run restaurant.	1
TITLE: Good Ending | TEXT: This dinner was redemption for a subpar lunch elsewhere. We both enjoyed the grilled salmon. Our server, Eve, must have realized we were tired after a tiring day and didn’t try to overwhelm us with too many “things,” for which I was grateful.  Worth a return visit when we come to Jax.	0
TITLE: Miami McDonald's?  Rude, Dirty, Horrendous | TEXT: Most of the McDonald's in this town are rude, dirty and horrendous, and this one is no exception.  Make you wonder why people would even buy food here.	0
TITLE: Consistently Fantastic! | TEXT: Ate outside under the trees and twinkly lights.  Beautiful. No reservation needed on a Sunday night for a great seat but it was still hopping.  Ordered from Happy Hour menu and the regular one, they have a great happy hour.  Polenta fries with marinara-Loved!  Steak bites-Loved!  Not a huge order but just right. Black bean soup-comes in a chicken type broth with veggies, was not what we expected but better-so delicious. Burger on lettuce with white cheddar, onion jam and avacado was excellent!   Consistently exceed expectations, not the usual run of the mill options so we always feel happily surprised, and you can't beat the great atmosphere and service.   This is a great first date place, casual dinner, group of friends or special event (smallish groups) location.  They fall somewhere between the cheap eats and the mid range.  You can get a good burger for $13.50 or a steak plate for between $19-26.	1
TITLE: Fantastic | TEXT: We have been here a few times and the food is amazing, and cooked fresh. The  staff is very friendly and you get great service. We would definitely recommend this restaurant to anyone.	0
TITLE: Farm to table done right | TEXT: Amazing farm to table restaurant with rotating menu based on seasonal ingredients. You can’t go wrong with the pork chop and ceviche but the real star was the cast iron corn bread. Drinks on great as well, highly recommend	0
TITLE: A little oasis after a bad day! | TEXT: We enjoyed everything about this place! The ambience, the architecture, the decor, the seating, the food, the wine and the service!  We had the farm greens salad and the buttermilk dressing was amazing.  Then the papardelle and the risotto.  Both delicious.  Kekoa was our server and he was just the perfect mix of intelligence, humor, knowledge (everything from the risotto to the jazz playlist) and discretion.  End of a horrible travel day for us that was all but forgotten as we soaked up all the goodness of this restaurant/bar.  We will be back.	1
TITLE: Museum and House Tour Make this a fun Visit | TEXT: A visit to this presidential library comprises three potential activities.  First, there is an hour long tour of his house.  Second, the main building includes a small exhibition of his time as President.  Lastly, a mile from the library is his memorial.  We spent just under two hours here.	0
TITLE: Don’t hesitate -  visit The Grange soon! | TEXT: We plan time to come here every time we are in Sacramento. The food, service and ambiance are all excellent! Even when we order something like a classic breakfast, it’s amazing. My brunch frittata was just delicious!!	0
TITLE: Very disappointed, not worth the trip | TEXT: We went for a birthday celebration and was very disappointed in the slow service and lack of knowledge of the server. order chilled seafood platter, steak and lobster and oyster rock fellows, the steak came first and waited a while before the chilled seafood plater came out and the oyster appetizer never came before our meals. the oysters on the chilled plate had lots of sand and shells in it and the steak was so so. The manager asked how your dinner was and told him of the problems and he did not say sorry or make any adjustment. All in all very disappointed birthday celebration	1
TITLE: Great place | TEXT: Excellent food and excellent service. The menu had all the right notes and did it very well. The Osso buco and the salmon were perfect.	0
TITLE: Best of the best | TEXT: This is the, not one of, but the finest restaurant in the country.  It's every bit as creative as a 3 star restaurant in France.  Corey Lee's melding of local ingredients with Asian fusion sauces, marinades and soups are so brilliant.  It is costly as one would expect a 3 star Michelin to be, but worth it.  The service is perfect, attentive without being cloying. I cannot recommend it more highly. We've lived in France many times, and I feel that we're blessed to have such a treasure locally.	0
TITLE: Fabulous TIME as always! | TEXT: Canada Berries has professional and knowledgable staff who are friendly and customer service oriented. They patiently waited on my friend and I and introduced 9 different types of wine for us to taste and informed us what types of food goes with each fruit wine, and the health benefits of each fruit. The wine is delicious, I really liked Blueberry and Raspberry wine. The location is also a great meeting space with a second floor which hosted an investor presentation that I attended last year. It is spacious and got a big TV with tables and chairs so it was perfect. I also attended a Chinese New Year festival several years ago there with over 1,000 people in attendance with lots of live entertainment under big tents with proper stage, and lots of vendors. It has a big parking lots and it's all free so it's a fantastic venue. I highly recommend this winery. I have given out many of their wine as gifts, and people really like it!	1
TITLE: Nice simple place. | TEXT: We had a table outside in this relatively quiet street. Good club sandwich and fries. Excellent salad. Nice evening with the family.	0
TITLE: Barely worth the price | TEXT: Oyster appetizer was really good. Chicken and snapper entrees were 5 out of 5s. Atmosphere was 5 out of 5. Our friends got the duck and really liked it. I thought it was tough but am not an aficionado. Service was 5 out of 5.	0
TITLE: Consistently delicious food made with seasonal ingredients, tasty cocktails, and great service! | TEXT: I’ve been here 6-7 times now over the last year, at least twice by myself just for the kale salad. I’ve brought out of town guests here as well as local friends and it’s been consistently delicious: the meal, the cocktails, and the service (we love Spencer!)…and we’ll keep coming back!	0
TITLE: 2 spilled drinks by waiter, no apologies | TEXT: We’ve been here quite a few times and have always had really good service, friendly older, and great experience. We went this past Sunday after church with our two kids 20 and 11 years old.  Got seated, ordered our drinks and we went up to the salad bar. When we got back to the table sat down they brought our drinks. One guy sat down my son drink, and it spilled all over the table. They moved everything from the center of the table, put down a towel and blotted  up what they could of the Coke and then another or a girl came around to my side between me and my daughter and she picked the glass up off the tray and I guess the tray was not centered and a whole cup of beverage spilled between me and my daughter on the floor it splattered on her brand new UGG shoes.  Now with what happened you would have thought they were going to either offer free dessert or comp the meal. Nope. Nothing.  This is not the experience you want your customers to have is it?	1
TITLE: Bday Dinner | TEXT: While visiting Portland for my wife's bday, we came here for dinner because it was recommended by a Lyft driver. Upon walking in, we were greeted very warmly with smiles. We were immediately seated. The waitress was very pleasant. I can't remember her name, but she was young with blonde hair and a facial piercing. She provided her recommendations by request. It took us a min to figure out what we wanted, but she was very patient.  We ordered the BBQ fried rice and boneless chicken thighs. It all came out hot and tasty. For dunks, we ordered Makers Mark whiskey with coke ave cherries and a tequila well drink. Both were delicious. We spoke to our waitress about how our time has been in Portland. She was very friendly. We ended the night with a special boozy slushy shot that she had made for my wife to help celebrate her bday. She put a candle in it and all. We loved that gesture!!!!  We highly reccomend this spot. Oh.. the ambiance was nice as well.	1
TITLE: Embarrassing Customer Service | TEXT: At about 1:30 this afternoon I visited the store on March Lane with my wife and got a cup of coffee I sat in the lobby for one hour drinking the coffee and I decided to get a refill I went to the register and asked the lady at the register whose name I don’t know to give me a refill but to my surprise she told me that I was not sitting in the lobby so she told me she couldn’t give me one I told her a couple of times that I was sitting in the lobby but still she didn’t believe me she went in and asked a colleague in the back room and the colleague confirmed that I came earlier and I was sitting in the lobby  That was very embarrassing  A manager came and apologised about what happen  I felt so embarrassed that I used to visit that store everyday but not anymore  My name is Jihad Basma and my phone number number is 2093199098	1
TITLE: Huge breakfast | TEXT: We’ve been here several times over the years and it’s always been great. Portions are huge and easily splittable. My wife and I split an omelette and along with the potatoes and toast we couldn’t finish it. Service was great. Our server was very friendly, helpful, personable, always there with more coffee, and didn’t rush us. We were at a family gathering so our server knew we had a lot of talking and catching up to do. It was a great experience and we’ll be back again.	1
TITLE: Cozy restaurant near Washington Square. | TEXT: We were in town to celebrate my wife's birthday. We tried this restaurant on a recommendation from my boss. The food was delicious. I had the Branzino and Broccoli, my wife had the Roasted Chicken and Gnocchi. We shared the the Chocolate Pudding cake which was delicious also. My wife really like the bread plates on each table. Each plate was different from the next and look like someone went searching thru some antique shops to pick them out. We ate inside because it was a little to windy to try the patio but it looked really and cozy.	0
TITLE: Mince | TEXT: The worst of the worst, absolutely gash. The staff are useless. Holding up cash to buy a simple carry out and ignored for 20 minutes.	1
TITLE: Fabulous Drag Brunch! | TEXT: We had a fabulous Drag Brunch! Performers were really amazing and absolutely stunning and the food & service was superb! Will definitely recommending it to all my friends! Shared this fun experience on my YouTube Channel @Rob Mahor if anyone wanna see it:) It was the best!	0
TITLE: Maximo! | TEXT: Amazing experience! Every plate a different surprise, my favorite was Cia Modena and the e Tortellini. Also, Gian Luca was a wonderful waiter who guided the whole experience.	0
TITLE: Always delightful staff! | TEXT: The food is delicious,  no doubt. What is extra special is the attentive, knowledgeable and really pleasant staff. Always makes us feel like we are the entire focus of our waiter's attention.	1
TITLE: Subpar | TEXT: Arrived to be seated near a birthday party going. While it wasn't the birthday party's fault, I think the party should have been held somewhere away from regular diners. They were loud and celebrating which was expected but again why have a party of 30 ppl in the center of a restaurant? After the party, the clean up consists of hitting the pillows loudly, moving furniture, and carrying long wooden tables over the heads of diners while we ate- (extremely dangerous) The food was subpar, (ordered the curry shrimp, salmon was the end of the fish with brown parts under, ravioli was like 12 pieces, the side (spicy yellow rice was hard). The food was not to Cipirani standards NYC or Dubai location. The view-  obstructed by plastic wrapped windows and no seating in a the patio space. The restaurant was cramped, tiny tables, low back chairs. I think the restaurant could have so much potential. Go to Casa Tua in Brickell for better Italian food and bypass this Cipirani. This location should be closed.	1
TITLE: Anniversary Dinner | TEXT: We were very excited to have dinner at Wa’z because our son took his girlfriend there for their anniversary and said it was amazing. The food was fabulous!  Every plate felt like a piece of art. Chef, and his team, was friendly and polite, as you would expect from a Japanese restaurant. We shared a Saki tasting, which was plenty for the two of us, and we loved the beautiful saki cups. Each one was so unique. Our only criticism is that the meal felt really rushed. We were seated at 8pm, served 10 courses and were done by 9.30!  We sat at the chef’s counter, and everyone was served each dish at the same time, so it wasn’t just that we were eating fast. It was an expensive evening, so I would have liked to linger.  On the bright side, we were given a little bouquet for our anniversary.	1
TITLE: The Best Mexican Food Around | TEXT: The food is great!  The amount of food is amazing.  Take your appetite with you.  The menu variety is excellent.  I love this place!	0
TITLE: Excellent restaurant choice near Fisherman's Wharf | TEXT: Pier Market Seafood is located on the waterfront about halfway down Pier 39. The tables look out to the waterfront for a lovely dinner setting. My wife and I enjoyed a delicious ceviche appetizer and then salmon and cioppino entrees, followed by two desserts that included ice cream on the side (we are ice cream junkies!). Service was professional, and the prices were very fare for the quality and setting. We would certainly return on our next trip to San Francisco (we go about every ten years!).	0
TITLE: Never rated a business so low in my life… | TEXT: We were enjoying some food and a drink earlier this evening and upon attempting to order a fernet to finish off our meal,  the bartender asked who was driving and wouldn’t let us place the order. No one was drunk, we were peacefully enjoying our treats, I hadn’t even drank 20% of my drink.  She may have been going through something personal because when I asked her name, she raised her eyebrows, swung her head, and raised her voice to say, “Would you just like to talk to the manager?!” We accepted the offer, but regardless, will never return. So sad.  When we first arrived and ordered our initial drinks, the patrons that left the seats we took were bragging about drinking a whole bottle of Don Julio 70 between the two of them along with the same bar tender. At that point, the bartender accidentally took our full drinks and dumped them. So we mentioned the error and she supplied replacements. As I said, I didn’t drink mine and my husband finished his by the time of her episode.  The manager explained they had just had some ABC training and they were buckling down. This would be entirely understandable. However, the bar tender’s  judgement was misplaced and targeted. That, in addition to her horrendous decorum, has destroyed the establishment’s rapport with us.	1
TITLE: Great service | TEXT: My friends and I met at Rue for drinks after a concert at Voodoo Doughnuts. The service was outstanding and we were allowed to just have drinks, though the menu looked quite intriguing. We ordered the almonds with rosemary and smoked beef fat, and they were to die for.	0
TITLE: Poor service.  Steak frites was too tough to eat.  Waiter and manager were not helpful.  They sat us outside when hot | TEXT: Poor service from both manager and waiter.  Steak frites was too tough to eat.  It was very hot and they could not get the fans on us and would not seat us inside.  There were many open tables inside so could have been a racial thing	1
TITLE: A rare disappointment by a reliable chain | TEXT: On my way out of town stopped for lunch before 5 hours of I-10 was in my future.  Service was great as usual.  But food was only average and I probably should have sent it back.  Started with the Chili, only available on Saturday.  Pretty good but a bit thinner than I prefer.  Id had it a few weeks ago at J Alexander in Atlanta and it was more hearty and thicker. Just a preference.   The French Dip was my entree, it was not great.  Bread was borderline stale and the roast beef was loaded with gristle and fat.  I only ate half.  Maybe just a bad day and it was after 2pm so kitchen was not at full strength but the restaurant was at least half full so business was good.   I’ll go back but I’ll be more quick to reject a poor entree this time.	1
TITLE: Nice vibe, food was disappointing | TEXT: The vibe is really lovely in the restaurant, and it’s one of the busiest in Austin too. However we felt that the food was average at best - we had to send back both of our sides as they arrived before the entrees and were both cold! The service was also very slow, and food took ages to come. Nice vibe, but not worth it for the price and the wait.	1
TITLE: Good place for wings | TEXT: This is for the location on Beechmont ave. It’s been a few years since I’ve been to this location. We were there on a Saturday evening and it didn’t appear to be really busy, but steady. Our order of  wings were hot and done just right as were the onion rings. They had plenty of help and our waitress was attentive at the right times. So we had a really good experience. My only knock is this, it’s rather noisy to the point of making conversation a little tough.	1
TITLE: Great food! | TEXT: This is our go-to location for Mexican Food. best in Stockton! This is located downtown. They make the best flour tortillas.	0
TITLE: Exceptional knowledge provided, kindness and a very professional crew. | TEXT: Unforgettable experience. The knowledge shared by sme’s was invaluable. The world needs Crow Canyon!   The expertise and educational opportunities provided by the center was exceptional. I highly recommend trips with Crow Canyon often.	0
TITLE: Do Not Stay Here! | TEXT: Hotel is old, in a terrible part of town.  Rooms not cleaned , trash on floors, mold in windows and curtains raggedy and unable to close.  It appears homeless people are living there and hanging outside. Very unsafe and not worth the money  at all.   Could not wait to leave.  Best thing there is the front desk employees.	1
TITLE: Perfect place to kick back and chill | TEXT: Me and my boyfriend went back to this hotel after a previous visit. 2 years ago. The hotel is mainly occupied by Russians and Egyptians, which is perfectly fine for us because we spend more time outside of the hotel than we did in the hotel. The food is ok and the chefs are willing to provide you with an alternative if you do not like what they have cooked. The staff are all lovely and the room was decent (they gave us the same room as the first time). Overall a nice chilled place.	0
TITLE: Awesome place! | TEXT: Staff are friendly! Good food! Good beer!! This place is amazing.  Haven’t try the 2 liter challenge yet but getting there.	0
TITLE: Top dinner experience in Northern California. | TEXT: My wife had wanted to go here for awhile,  since she is a vegan and they vegan options. She couldn’t decide among the various choices, so I suggested the two person tasting menu. They created and vegan masterpiece. The variety of flavors was amazing. Some of the offerings were among the best food I have ever had, vegan or otherwise.  This place is a gem and we had one of the best dinner experiences ever! We did not have wine with dinner, so if that is important, check out the wine list ahead of time. Our only complaint was that there was too much food, but that was erased when we enjoyed a nice lunch of left overs the next day. Finally, for those who love meat, as the name suggests, they have many other choices besides vegan. Try this place and I bet it becomes a regular dinner spot for you and your loved ones.	1
TITLE: Truly Unique and Delicious | TEXT: This was the best restaurant experience my wife and I had in a while.  The experience was top notch from arrival to departure. Service was friendly, helpful,and attentive. Food was imaginative, beautifully cooked and presented.  Every dish, from amuse bouche to dessert had interesting flavors, quality ingredients, and lovely presentation. No dish was like anything we’ve had anywhere else. This is a kitchen with a truly unique (and delicious) point of view.	0
TITLE: Awesome front desk | TEXT: The staff at front desk is outstanding. Especially Tatiana, and her associate. They adjusted our 3rd party booking like true professionals.	0
TITLE: Nice cozy Resturant | TEXT: the atmosphere was nice and cozy  , sea food is cooked very well and the service was really nice and friendly . it is a BYOB restaurant	0
TITLE: Subpar at best | TEXT: I don’t understand where all these great reviews are coming from, but don’t be fooled like I was. First of all, the service was subpar. We asked our server repeatedly for a baby booster seat and she never brought it, so I finally had to get up and look for where they were kept. She also didn’t bring the juice we ordered for our toddler till the end of the meal. Have you ever dealt with a thirsty toddler? Not good. Also, we ordered bottomless mimosas and only got one refill, after asking repeatedly for it. Our glasses were empty most of the meal. Now the food. We ordered eggs Benedict and the eggs were hard boiled, served over stale bread with just a little bit of hollandaise. It was gross. The only good food was the side of bacon we ordered for our toddler. Overall this was by far the worst restaurant experience I have ever had, especially because it ruined Father’s Day for my husband.	1
TITLE: Best taste Seafood in town ! | TEXT: We’re inviting by friends to check on this Seafood Restaurant. We were surprised by the food!! Great food 🥘 Good service !!  Definitely will Be back😘	0
TITLE: Jeju Spirited Garden | TEXT: Well worth a visit if you're in Jeju, South Korea.  Sang Bum Young pictured here,  is the creator of this Bonsai garden. It had taken him 57 years to create.	0
TITLE: Nice, but not great | TEXT: It was a little out of the way from where we were staying.  Our initial waitress obviously did not know much about the menu.  She gave us incorrect responses to our questions.  Upon entering we were asked in a rather abrupt way to show our vaccination cards - we all 6 had these, but it was not done in a very nice manner.  Dinner was good - not great.  I would not tell someone to waste their dining experience here, especially given the wait staff.	1
TITLE: Don't order curries from the buffet menue | TEXT: Ordered food from the buffet menu for my husbands birthday party. Was horrified to find that the curries were just cause with no meat. Phoned round all the guests incase it was just me that got no meat but all said that there wasn't any in the curries. I was mortified. Phoned to complain and was told manager would phone me next day. Stil waiting for the call but guess it isn't coming any time soon. Was a valued customer of 13 years. Won't go back. Con artists!	1
TITLE: Nice small family restaurant | TEXT: This is a nice fast sea food restaurant. Service is very friendly and quality of food is good. Prices are reasonable.	0
TITLE: Loyal to my party. | TEXT: After having lunch there, I was told by a friend they would not let the Democratic Party meet in their dining room.  I wish I would have known this.  Will not go there again.	0
TITLE: Worst Dining Experience | TEXT: I called ahead and was told outdoor seating is available on a first come first server basis.  Upon arrival I was greeted by a bearded gentleman in a sports coat who informed me that outdoor seating was not available for at least 30 minutes despite the fact that I could see three empty tables.  When I informed him that I would be happy to wait he told me to go ahead and leave and come back in 30 minutes and if a table is available at that time, he would let me know.  He was very condescending in his tone the entire time.  Since they were booked for seats at least 2 weeks out I decided to stay so I could experience the food.  I ordered a pasta dish and it was absolutely delicious.  The waiter was pleasant.  I plan to return back to this restaurant multiple times and leave similar feedback if I have a like-kind experience.	1
TITLE: Overrated restaurant | TEXT: Quite disappointed tbh. Nothing special; service was fair but not great. I had a Calle Ocho Special sandwich, the bacon was almost inexistent it was a joke. It comes with french fries, I asked to change with another side I was told I could not when it’s just fries…coming with a sandwich so clearly it is possible, they just didn’t want to. The fries were not even good or fresh they look the same as at McDonalds. Plantains were okay but I’ve had better they were not even hot. The only great thing was the cafe cubano.	1
TITLE: Delicious | TEXT: My Swai fish sandwich was delicious and our server was amazing. She made some great suggestions as she knew I had no clue what to order.  She even had us sign the wall.	0
TITLE: Outstanding! | TEXT: The kaiseki dinner at Wa'z is one of the best dining experiences I've had. Service was attentive and each course as well as the paired sakes were explained. If Seattle had Michelin stars, this restaurant would be on their list.   We were lucky to sit at the counter and were able to watch as dishes were prepared. There were eight courses that were paced well over about two hours. For me, the highlights included Copper River salmon sashimi, wagyu that melted in your mouth, grilled eel, and tuna nigiri, but each course was fantastic. The chef and other staff spoke to us about the provenance of the food as well as providing stories/history on why we were eating certain items.  At $600+ for dinner for two (including alcohol), this is a special occasion restaurant, but the experience was worth it.	1
TITLE: Beyond incredible, one of the best dining experiences ever! | TEXT: There are not enough superlatives to describe our dining experience at Eem.  The White curry with Brisket Burnt-ends was absolutely superb, the Massaman curry with smoked lamb shoulder was beyond incredible, the Very Spicy Papaya Salad was delightful (and a good challenge to any pepper heads) and the Thai-style Ceviche provided an exemplary presentation and tasting of kanpachi.  You could really sense that the entire restaurant staff from greeters to servers to line cooks and chefs were committed to providing a memorable dining experience.   We can't wait to go back and try out the other menu items!	1
"TITLE: Nothing spectacular | TEXT: The restaurant is in an older building that is looking tired inside (and that's different than vintage). It doesn't really have any identifiable appeal. However, the food was good and everyone seemed to enjoy their meals. Many people took advantage of the ""dine in Portland"" $33 - 3 course special. I had crab cakes that were very tasty. Brussel sprout appetizers and the fresh bread were both fabulous."	1
TITLE: Riff of Miami not nice | TEXT: I hope you read my review before you eat and not after as i did. Food average Told Happy hour ..but 2 beers still cost € $25 for 2 beers. Service 20% and we were shouted at tat we had to pay it. Not a good example of how to treat customers in your town AVOID AVOID AVOID. This has left a very bad impression of your town and your restaurant.   Rip off	1
TITLE: Great neighborhood spot to grab a bite | TEXT: We have eaten here several times for a Hicks meal or dessert.  This restaurant has a wide variety of delicious food from hamburgers to Asian stew over rice.  Plus they have specialty coffees, ice cream and baked goods.  There is something on their menu to satisfy everyone’s palate.	0
TITLE: Perfect ! | TEXT: One of the most beautiful restaurants I’ve been to. Perfect rooftop location and great atmosphere.. Drinks and food were outstanding. This was my favorite dining experience on my trip to Boston. I will definitely be back.	0
TITLE: Inattentive time wasters | TEXT: I sat at the bar but was not told that the hostess seats people at the bar.  I waited 10 minutes watching the bartender ignore me.  Then I asked for a table and had to wait longer.  I spent 15 minutes waiting for anyone to acknowledge me.  This used to be a nice place but they went downhill fast!  My waitress apologized and I finally got my order in, but now I know where not to go if I am looking for a place that does not treat customers like trash.	1
TITLE: Overrated | TEXT: When we arrived we had to wait for our table which we didnt mind and was told to wait at the bar, but this was soooo busy and struggled to get to the bar. Kids sat at the bar too which we didnt like. Got our table which was near the bar and had people banging into us. My partner asked the woman at the reservations desk if we could move to the other table of two which had just been set up and got told if we want to wait an hour and  a half for a new table then we can but otherwise we had no choice but to sit there!!!! We was not happy about this as she was rude with it. Our server was lovely couldnt fault her (didnt catch her name) and the food was average. Once we got our bill we was shocked at the price as we have had nicer and better service for less.	1
"TITLE: Awesome Food, Awesome People | TEXT: Stopped in today for lunch.  The people were super nice and very accommodating for my handicapped brother.  We ordered and sat down.  They brought our soft drinks to us.  After a little while out came my brother's ""club"" sandwich on Dutch Crust which he loved.  His garlic fries looked so good I had to try them.  Terrific.  I had heard about the ""A Plate Above"" meal and had to try it.  It came out and to my surprise it actually looked bigger and better than I had expected.  My three items were Kalbi short ribs, Teriyaki beef steak, and deep fried shrimp all serve on a bed of white rice with a side of mac salad.  It was a fantastic meal for only $13.95.  I could only eat half before getting full.  We were checked on at least twice to see if we need anything by a smiling young lady.  Once the boss came out to tell us about the deals they are having for vets on Veterans Day.  He was all smiles too... as were we.  I live 50 miles away and I may become a steady customer!"	1
TITLE: Quick bite | TEXT: A quick bite and drinks in the bar area. Service was top notch. No issues.  Nothing special but easy if you are a guest of the hotel.	0
TITLE: Great hotel stay! | TEXT: Microtel is conveniently located near Mohegan Sun casino.  The hotel is quiet, very clean and comfortable. Staff are always friendly.	0
TITLE: Not bad for authentic. | TEXT: Has changed a lot over the years, but not bad.  Too much gravy, and gravy mixed with too much flour.  Service was slow considering the amount of patrons...not many either time.  Overpriced for the quality.	1
"TITLE: Prioritize my bladder!!!! | TEXT: Hello,  I regret  to inform you that your staff needs to be engaged in coaching, due to the lack of attention to a female and I needing to use the restrooms after multiple attempts to utilize them. I was ignored by the first female and was given a puzzled look that they can't be opened. After I went around to seek attention from the other staff she rudely stated both bathrooms are not available, after I asked why she said "" they just are "". I asked to see what would cause them to be unusable but could only feel discriminated as she added no urgency to the issue. She then asked if I was management to even request to see the inside of the bathrooms. As a LONG TIME CUSTOMER. I suggest to keep your client based loyal to address this issue as it leaves a bad image on the franchise. I left feeling ""I didn't have it my way "". And that's just a bowl movement. Thank you for your time and I hope this matter has been addressed the next time I pass by the store as I will try to obtain pictures of the staff reluctant to assist.   Best regards,  JJ."	1
TITLE: More cities should have a Reading Terminal with its excellent regional food choices and great prices | TEXT: I love coming to the Reading Terminal Market with the great selection of food stalls and the sights and smells as you walk around. I love their selections and the interaction between the locals and tourists when people are ordering.   Some of my favorite places to eat in Philly are here with Dutch Eating Place, Beilers Bakery and Bassetts Ice Cream. When Carmine’s was open, that used to be my favorite place for Cheesesteaks. After a meal, I like to walk around and look at the food displays. Everyone merchandises their food so nicely.  Don’t miss a visit here when you are visiting Philly.	0
TITLE: Outstanding Place for Breakfast/Brunch | TEXT: The Dutch has changed a bit since some of these pictures.  It has upgraded the atmosphere, and the food continues to be outstanding. The wait staff is fast, friendly and efficient.  We had a egg white omelet and 3-Egg breakfast.  I recommend the sausage; its some of the best I've have had in a while (but spicy).   Great local place, quiet and good for talking.	1
TITLE: Excellent Flavor | TEXT: The service was highly attentive and the food items that we had the watermelon salad and the lamb meatballs were both really creative and tasted excellent. I recommend it for this. It’s also extremely close to high-end shopping and strolling around.	0
TITLE: DON’T Do it. | TEXT: Awful food. Overpriced.  Their chicken Parmesan is easy to replicate.  Take a chicken breast, bread it, burn it in a pan (yes. Extra crispy), throw a can of tomato paste on it (generic can damaged from multiple floor drops) over cheese the top, add some spaghetti on the sides (like 1/2 the normal side portion), and BAMM—you saved 24 bucks.  Oh...make sure you have TUMS for the blowback later that night.   Mic drop!	1
TITLE: So so experience | TEXT: Flavors are nice. Rations sizes  are tiny.  Octopus overcook and cold  Nice atmosphere in a snail place  You shall book your visit	1
TITLE: Delicious and very reasonably priced | TEXT: The front door is a little hard to see, but glad we found it. The food was spectacular! I got the Sea of Indochine and it was loaded with fresh seafood . My husband got green curry and lived it. Spice level 4 was perfect for us. Great ambiance, great service.	1
TITLE: Great restaurant | TEXT: What a lovely restaurant.. attentive staff, great atmosphere and FOOD!  Lots of it and perfectly cooked..  Grilled lamb (which was like a casserole) with rice, hot meze platter, lamachun,  and flat bread with dips. A glass of wine and a beer. At £50 it was  great value too!	0
"TITLE: Town Secret | TEXT: Hidden gem! Great Mom & Pop owned business. Mom is out front greeting, smiling and taking orders and serving. After your order is taken, if necessary, Pop will talk to you from the kitchen to ask, "" Would you like onions on that?""  ""Did you watch the game yesterday?"" ""Hey there! I  haven't seen you in a while. How are you?"" The food is as good as the owners! The fried spare ribs are the bomb!! I have seen the police, fire departments, teachers and students there. It was a Florida Caverns ranger who told me that I had to try their food.  I keep going back!"	0
TITLE: Authentic Kaiseki Course Dinner in Downtown Seattle | TEXT: Wa'z offers Michelin level kaiseki cuisine, which is an artistic and traditional style of multi-course cooking from Japan, probably Kyoto.  The January 8 course menu was highlighted by a dish with New Year offerings of kazunoko (herring eggs), datemaki (rolled egg dish), grilled fish and a sashimi roll. This course meal progresses with sashimi and other types of seafood. A5 Wagyu is featured twice.  The white miso ozoni was very good and in middle courses, the Chef serves a sampler of pressed sushi and aged tuna nigiri.    If you choose counter seating, you can see the Chef and his colleagues at work.  The preparation unfolds before your eyes and it made me appreciate how much skill is involved with the presentation.  The dinner lasted 90 to 100 minutes and my group left fully satisfied.	1
TITLE: Fantastic brunch spot | TEXT: This was probably our favourite meal in San Francisco… great range of brunch options and fantastic friendly service- highly recommend	0
TITLE: Best taste Seafood in town ! | TEXT: We’re inviting by friends to check on this Seafood Restaurant. We were surprised by the food!! Great food 🥘 Good service !!  Definitely will Be back😘	0
TITLE: Perfect dinner spot | TEXT: This was a perfect dinner spot after the show at Preservation Hall Jazz. We ate upstairs and would have enjoyed the balcony but skipped it because of the rain when we were there.	0
TITLE: Brilliant. Best steak ever. | TEXT: This restaurant has lovely view of the harbour from the terrace. The staff are very attentive and friendly. All areas pleasant and very clean. The food was delicious the best steaks we have had during our holiday, husband enjoyed the mash potatoes 😋 nice change from chips.	0
TITLE: Simply Philadelphia's Finest. | TEXT: I've eaten here 5 times. Each time the meal has been perfect and the service simply outstanding. It's my go to fine dining experience in Philly.	0
TITLE: Highly recommend the 7 course chef’s tasting menu! | TEXT: We 3 had the 7 course chef’s tasting menu and we shared a bottle of wine. The sommelier did a great job recommending a wine that would work well with the range of flavors. It did go very well with the meal which was outstanding. The food was wonderful and beautifully presented. The service was outstanding. We had a terrific evening.	0
TITLE: Perfect Spot in Rittenhouse SQ | TEXT: Food was exceptional. Staying in Center City / Rittenhouse SQ and Google Best Restaurants near me turns up lots of options. This place did not disappoint. Fig & Ricotta salad plus their Rotolo pasta dish were just right. Certainly give them a try. Had no reservation, I just sat at a bar side table, it was a Sunday however.	0
TITLE: Excellent brunch | TEXT: We went there for brunch before a matinee, expecting a coffee shop. Boy were we surprised. The decorations are charmingly rustic, the server we had was very friendly and helpful. The food… ah yes, the food. It was superb. I had a porchetta hash with eggs, one of us had the chillaquilles, and the third of us had eggs Benedict, with porchetta. All were pronounced excellent. We’ll certainly be back after discovering this treasure.	0
TITLE: Dining experience out the window | TEXT: I was in the restaurant industry for a decade bw 2000-2010.  It was all about customer service, timing the meals properly and the dining experience. I was front and back of the house. I let it slide that this place did all bottled cocktails??  Bc I was so excited to see my friend. But no bar to make a proper drink-noted. Then upon arrival…..we were notified that there was a reservation 1.5 hours later so essentially “don’t hurry but hurry up.”  Slightly off putting but We agreed and got back to our bottled Negronis. Then not even 10 minutes later, another staff member came by and asked if we made any decisions. We hadn’t yet. She then told us “we just want to make sure we’re on the same page that there are people coming at 7:30.”  That was it. Bill please?  We were done. Timing tables is a bogus thing that happened in the hospitality industry. Until these folks figure out how to manage it better?  Don’t bother.	1
TITLE: Isolated and enigmatic- a good addition to a 'Desert Castle' tour | TEXT: Not much to see and not a lot is known about the site. It is thought it was a caravanserai. While named 'Qasr' (castle) the towers are solid and the slits in the walls unsuitable for arrows but useful for ventilation. I visited as part of a tour group- one of 3 sites visited under the 'Desert Castles' label as half a day trip.  The ride from Amman to the Qasr/s is flat desert and military sites with the occasional camel to spot and the 'castles' are easily spotted from the road. Each has their own point of interest. You can explore the many rooms of the caravanserai, peek out into the desert, imagine the travellers who may have journied here, consider how different the location must have been in less arid days. A lonely location- not something to make a special trip to on its own, but as part of a tour of similar structures it is a nice day out.	0
TITLE: Barton G’s should be ashamed | TEXT: This restaurant was once spectacular, just like their website touts but now it is extremely old and worn out.  The food is basic.  The service was fine but management didn’t care.  I was expecting Hollywood and Disney and all I got was a traveling carnival.  No wonder they are closing	0
"TITLE: Good Tex-Mex in Dripping Springs, TX | TEXT: Verde's delivers quality Tex-Mex food.  Another good meal enjoyed recently...  the complimentary chips and salsa are da bomb!  Light crisp chips, and the salsa tastes like it just came out of the garden... super fresh ingredients!   We had a couple of the ""Lime in the Coconut"" cocktails, reminiscent of a pina colada, but better, and not too sweet.  Very good.  For food, we settled on the  pollo flautas (chicken flautas) and the fish tacos.  Both were very good, and the flautas were some of the best we've ever had.  The tacos were stuffed full of fish and fresh veggies.  We sat at the bar this visit, and the bartender was super-busy, so not much time to visit.  Recommend Verde's for good Tex-Mex in the Dripping Springs area."	1
TITLE: Best breakfast with most awesome everything! | TEXT: Great family experiencence with personalized treatment, awesome coffee choices and best grits plus home made fresh bagels. Stopping there on way back to get a take home order of bagels and lunch!	0
TITLE: You will NOT find cliché menu offerings here! | TEXT: I researched both State Bird Provisions and The Progress and we selected The Progress for our dinner while visiting San Francisco for 2 nights. We love restaurants that are trying new things and The Progress delivered! We shared 5 dishes and then ordered two desserts, and we enjoyed every morsel. It was enough food for me, but my husband was still a little hungry when we left (he grabbed an apple back at the hotel) so perhaps we should have ordered another dish or even the duck—which was a lot of food but looked crispy and spectacular. Our favorites were the Tuna Crudo and the dramatic Brown Butter Seaweed Noodles, but truly everything was delicious.  This is a special occasion experience, so it is pricey, but its worth it to sample innovative  and sustainable food. I am not posting food pictures because mine did not do the food justice due to the lighting, but the presentations were lovely and creative.	0
TITLE: Fun and Funky Tex Mex | TEXT: The sign is hilarious.  The location has two patios and an interior dining room.  Lots of open air seating for those concerned about disease prevention.  The menu is typical tex mex, with some surprises.  I really enjoyed the green mole and enchiladas.  Zoe was helpful, efficient and eager to be of assistance.  The prices were very reasonable for downtown Austin.	1
TITLE: Romantic dinner | TEXT: Wonderful dinner and service.  The lamb chops were delicious and the presentation was wonderful. Great wine selection!	0
"TITLE: Worth the visit!!! | TEXT: I was very impressed with the Warren G. Harding Presidential Sites.  We took the tour of his house, and listened first hand from the tour guides all about when Harding gave speeches on the ""front porch"".  The house is stunning and is 90+ percent original from years ago when Warren and his wife Florence lived in the house.  The tour guides can answer any questions you have off the top of their heads.  The  Library & Museum was finished in the spring of 2021 and they have a nice gift shop in there too.  They spared no expense in the construction of the building - it is beautiful!!!!  If you are a history buff, this is a must do."	0
TITLE: Great staff , food, and rooftop views | TEXT: A hotel staff member recommended this restaurant to us, and it was a great recommendation. There is a rooftop bar for appetizers and drinks, with great views, facing the river. (Rooftop opened after 4 pm)  The restaurant on lower level was open earlier in the day and has a nice outdoor patio, as well as inside seating.  The dinner prices are a bit on the higher side but the food and staff are wonderful. The menu is varied. It was my birthday and the staff surprised me with a birthday card signed by the whole staff. Very sweet and appreciated.  Cee cee  of the hostess station is a beautiful and delightful person. She made sure we had a great table. Our server on the rooftop, Vanessa, was fantastic. And our restaurant server, Cora, were all great. Thank you for making it a great night. All of our food was fantastic. I had the salmon, and it was great. The restaurant is perfect for casual, business, and special dining  occasions. I look forward to returning.	0
TITLE: Good artist but..... | TEXT: The bar is rather dirty - lots of sticky stuff around.  I also found the staff fairly indifferent to the customers.  After reading their FAQ on their website I should have anticipated the service.  Other bars in Chicago have good shows, in clean places with attentive staff.	1
TITLE: Disappointing Value | TEXT: We ended up paying an absurd amount for dishes that simply weren’t worth it. As the photos show, the presentation and portion sizes were underwhelming, and the overall experience didn’t justify the price. The only redeeming quality was the meat. Unfortunately, that alone doesn’t make up for the poor value for money.	0
TITLE: Unique experience with terrific food and showmanship owner | TEXT: Wonderful lamb loin, swordfish, salmon and veal.  Loved food creatively presented and delicious.  Best mashed potatoes ever.  Moderate wine prices and attentive service.  A Sacramento gem.	0
TITLE: Versailles Restaurant | TEXT: We went to the Versailles Restaurant to sample their legendary Cuban sandwich.  Cuban Sandwich Recipe -  roast pork, ham, Swiss cheese, pickles, and yellow mustard, pressed inside Cuban bread until the bread is crispy and the cheese is melted  It was delicious!	0
TITLE: Exceeded expectations | TEXT: Our first dining experience at the woolworth exceeded expectations. Both the food and drinks were excellent. Our server Brayan was fantastic both personable and attentive.	0
TITLE: Fantastic birthday celebration with family | TEXT: We celebrated my husband’s birthday and the experience was phenomenal. We have dined at Commander’s once before but we brought our two teenaged kids with us this time. They enjoyed the experience as much as we did! I called ahead to confirm this was a birthday celebration, so they made note of my husband’s name. When we arrived the host immediately wished him a happy birthday by name. Each person that interacted with our table wished him a happy birthday. We had impeccable service throughout the evening. The service staff are a well-oiled machine! We had an incredible meal and it was a special way to celebrate!	0
TITLE: Salt bombs | TEXT: Creative menu. Ordered halibut and ceviche and quesadilla and guacamole and several other items. The sea bass looked fantastic and flavors were promising. Big issue: everything was oversalted but a substantial amount. Most items were barely edible due to this. I came home and my heart was pounding. Avoid this place.  They seem to aim to kill you with salt.	1
TITLE: Extremely, extremely outdated | TEXT: The man at the front desk was very friendly, but besides that, there wasn't much that was great about this motel. I was a little scared at first, but was assured from people around the area that it's a safe place and town to stay. The motel is extremely, extremely outdated. The towels are very old and the pillows are very, very flat. Breakfast was advertised at the time of my booking this motel, but there wasn't any. This is budget friendly for sure, but that's probably the only plus regarding this motel.	1
TITLE: Food was mediocre. | TEXT: Food was mediocre and portions tiny. Wagyu beef and chicken skewers were chewy and very salty. Tempura cauliflower and dumplings were ok.	1
TITLE: Top Top Tapas | TEXT: We went with some local friends who have been multiple times and it was possibly the best Tapas I have had. Amazing knowledgeable staff who could not enough to help. Food sensational. So much flavour. We loved it.	0
TITLE: Fantastic San Francisco Lunch Spot with Top-Notch Hospitality | TEXT: We came here with a large group to celebrate a team member's promotion, and even though we hadn't given the restaurant a heads-up (on a busy Friday as Fleet Week was kicking off, no less!), the owner and her team couldn't have been more accommodating. The owner and her team welcomed us warmly, found space for our group, and made sure everyone was comfortable and well taken care of throughout the night. The service was attentive without being rushed, and you could tell they genuinely cared that we had a great experience.  They even brought out additional umbrellas and helped move them around to protect us from the bright sun that day. The atmosphere was lively and inviting--exactly what you want for a celebration--and the scenery, with that one-of-a-kind San Francisco backdrop, made it even better. A big thank you to the staff and owner for turning what could've been a logistical headache into a wonderful, memorable lunch for our team! We'll definitely be back.	1
"TITLE: Barton G will exceed your expectations with Gusto | TEXT: If you are looking for an out of the ordinary dinner experience, Barton G is your place. Located in an adjacent street to Alton road. Its unassuming entrance does not give out what a gem is waiting for patrons. The reception was warm and inviting. They sat the 8 us of us fast and with a smile. Our host for the evening was Ronaldo and he was fantastic. The ""experiential cuisine"" was palpable and exhilarating. Every dish, from drinks, appetizers, entries and desserts we a work of art in themselves. The dishes were delicious and full of rich flavors. We were celebrating a birthday and it is a perfect place to have such celebration. Overall an A+++ experience."	0
TITLE: Def worth a visit! | TEXT: Well if you can’t find some food here, there is something wrong with you. All the local stuff you would expect plus bundles of ice cream, fresh meats and cheeses, and chocolate.  Well worth an hour of your time.	0
TITLE: Overpriced | TEXT: Wasn’t impressed with this place only went in for a drink. Had two local beers and one vodka was charged $46. Couldn’t even see receipt it was so light and didn’t get a proper receipt. Sent instagram msg but didn’t get reply. Complete rip off	1
"TITLE: A nice cafe, a good but simple menu, not too large, and not too noisy. | TEXT: A friend went to Portland to visit family. They recommended that he and I meet at ""The Observatory"" on SE Stark Street. It is a small place, not at all noisy as I recall. I looked that the menu before I left to drive down to Portland. We got a booth by the front door, but it wasn't chilly (fall weather these days). My friend had an Elk Burger with cajin fries and an IPA beer. I had a Ruben sandwich with plain fries. Since I was driving home after lunch I stuck with water. I was quite pleased with my lunch, and the fries were the best fries that I have had in a long, long time. My friend praised the IPA on the first sip. He too liked his burger and fries.   We got there around 11:30 AM, and by noon all of the seating was occupied. The service was really great! There was not any kind of excess noise problem. I imagine some rowdy folks would come in from time to time, but the atmosphere was very nice during our visit.   Before we finished eating there was a small crowd gathered outside the door, waiting to get in. There was a crowd still there when we left. The servers didn't try to encourage us to leave, we left when we were ready."	1
TITLE: Best family style food for group brunch. | TEXT: We were here for a wedding brunch in the back and the staff couldn’t have been more accommodating. The food was excellent and we all enjoyed the brunch tremendously.	0
TITLE: Must try Yemeni food! | TEXT: This is a really fun place to try right in the heart of olde city on chestnut street.  Dense small dining room.  Exceptionally friendly service.  Very unusual menu and flavor profiles than any other place in Philly.  We shared all our dishes family style so got to try a lot.  Portions were very big. We had both signature chichen dishes.  Both were a bit dry and didn’t pop with flavor. The lamb haneeth though burst with flavor and the Yemeni egg and cheese might be the sleeper standout on the menu.  The hummus and falafel was a yummy app.  Prices are a bit high across the board. A must try but not a must repeat.	1
TITLE: More cities should have a Reading Terminal with its excellent regional food choices and great prices | TEXT: I love coming to the Reading Terminal Market with the great selection of food stalls and the sights and smells as you walk around.

Some of my favorite places to eat in Philly are here with Dutch Eating Place, Beilers Bakery and Bassetts Ice Cream. When Carmine’s was open, that used to be my favorite place for Cheesesteaks.

"TITLE: defamation of character | TEXT: I came into station 16 today as I always do because this is one of my favorite restaurants to visit. My alcoholic beverage was watery and I sent it back. general manager RJ ( who refused to give me his real name who was rude) start talking stuff stating every time I come in here it's an issue and the last time I had an issue with the server. Mind you he was the server I complained about before he became general manager because when he was a server he had the same nasty attitude and I complained to his manager at the time and I'm sorry if a server is being rude to me im going to let upper management know that is my right and if my food comes out not good or cold as a PAYING customer I have a right to have them remake it never was rude always respectful. The fact that he stated this false accusation in front of other customers and staff badgering my character (that's defamation of character which my friend I was with recorded this) he made me feel so humiliated, uncomfortable and he embarrassed me! When I asked to speak with the chain of command he refused and stated with a smart gesture and said ""he's the general manager and he's the last of the chain of command and if the owners want to call me they will and that's if the owner feels like calling me"" and he will let them know it's always an issue which is very much false and I feel he's making this up to cover up his wrong doing and to retaliate against me for when I complained on him. Not only did he humiliated me but defamation of character, I will be taken this further more legally. The disrespect and attitude was uncalled for and very unprofessional and I will be taken actions all the way. Mind you I haven't been here in months because I had kidney surgery (life threatening) and was fighting for my life and came out to celebrate life and this how I'm treated. Run back the cameras and you will see how I was treated and how he humiliated me in front  of staff and customers because he wanted to retaliate. By him being a general manager he should of conducted hisself way better and professionally. He is in place to defuse any issues not make them worst and not to be rude or retaliate against me because he was complained on and now taken this personal. He approached my table with the smart remarks and my friend had me asked him again what he said so we can get it on recording and he did."	1

Highly recommended.	0
TITLE: Cold food | TEXT: I must give up coming to this location!  They take the order so far from the pay window, approx 40+ cars in line.  By the time I get my hamburger it is COLD!

TITLE: Quality dining at a fair price. | TEXT: Our fish dinners were excellent and skinny bread sticks fun. The included gorgonzola salad dressing hit the mark. We like eating fish out.	0
TITLE: My new favorite restaurant. | TEXT: Wow! What an absolute gem. This restaurant is a total winner. The food is delicious, the service superb, the ambience perfect. Everything you would need for a wonderful meal out.	0
TITLE: Delicious Pasta and Great Atmosphere” | TEXT: Had a lovely dinner at Grotto during our time in Boston. We had the chicken parmigiana pasta and the pasta bolognese — both were full of flavor and really satisfying. The atmosphere was warm and welcoming, the service was friendly, and prices felt fair for the quality. A great little spot for a relaxed Italian dinner.	0
TITLE: Avoid this place | TEXT: I visited Nusr-Et in Istanbul and had an excellent experience, so I was expecting something similar from this branch — but it fell far short. The service was very poor, and the meal was wildly overpriced. The staff lacked professionalism and attention, which made the entire experience disappointing. Management should seriously address the service quality. Overall, I felt scammed. Not recommended at all. Avoid this place.	0
TITLE: Downtown Secret | TEXT: Local breakfast and lunch spot in town across from the old Chipola Hotel , gazebo out front , enter from the rear or the front door , grab a table , get more food than what you should pay.	0
TITLE: Great Brunch! | TEXT: We have gone on several occasions for brunch on Sundays. The food is amazing! I recommend the fried greens tomatoes, blue cheese chips and  egg rolls! Yummmmm! Staff is always awesome!	0
TITLE: Delightful historic and traditional grill | TEXT: Came for lunch. Old style grill that has been restored to former glory. Staff are kitted out in traditional French style with waistcoats and starched aprons. Greeted in a warm way. Sam took my order and looked after me very well. Started with a small cup of chowder, which was very creamy and thick. A nice small tasty starter. Followed this with an excellent seared beef tenderloin salad with delicious crispy toast covered with goats cheese. A most enjoyable lunch before leaving Portland to fly home. Recommend.	1
TITLE: Beautiful presentation lacks substance and taste. | TEXT: The presentation is outstanding, the food looks incredible unfortunately it lacks taste. My second time there and last. The best item wasn't on the menu,  the amuse bouche. It was a mushroom soup and fantastic. Also delicious, the Dungeness crab crepe. The Cauliflower starter was disappointed as was the diakon radish dish. Both looked incredible but didn't taste so. The pasta dish with truffle was twofold. The pasta was delicious BUT the copious amount of truffle the chef grated onto each plate not only looked disgusting but tasted disgusting. I have been to Italy,  we love truffle. My husband is a chef. We weren't sure what grade of truffle we were eating but not on par with the French Laundry. The main dish, a beef roll of sorts was tough and chewy. The desert,  a cherry cheesecake another disappointment. I will give them the chocolate chip cookies and tiny cappuccino cream puff, both delicious. The wine list is outrageously expensive and the choices lacking. I suggest you pay the corkage and bring your own wine. Spending $500 on a dinner for two that looked pretty and listening to an arrogant loud, screaming chef all night....not worth the money in my opinion.	1
TITLE: not my favourite | TEXT: Very crowded, tables really close together - music so loud that you could not talk to your partner - tried several appetizers but we were not overwhelmed. Would not go again.	1
"TITLE: HArd to find but worth the effort!! | TEXT: It's all about the food-and this place has some wonderful authentic delicious food!!!   I am from the Caribbean &  most restaurants think if you put a fried banana on a plate that will make it Caribbean food...no not true!  The Caribbean is a a melting pot with complex cuisine...Spanish, French, African, Indian, Dutch, Portuguese, influences.  The Breadfruit Tree is Caribbean food.  Louis the owner was so friendly- the food was delicious.  I thought I was ""home"" and my grandmother was in the kitchen. We started with a rum punch...but this wasn't any old rum punch...this was a really West Indian Rum punch...tastes so good but packs a punch!!!  We had the food served family style & we ordered the sweet fish, curry, jerk chicken, peleau...OMG everything was delicious!!!! The menu changes daily so you have to read the chalkboard...I was hoping for Roti...but it wasn't on the chalkboard.  However, Louis did tell me if I call ahead he'd make sure it was on the menu the next time I came by. Service was good- drinks arrived quickly- food took a little time...but if you go with good company the wait won't matter, because it's worth the wait!!! They are open seasonally so call ahead if its not boating season...if the weather is good they may be there.  I can hardly wait to go back...I almost forgot save room for desert- the chocolate bread pudding tastes just like my granddad's bread pudding & I only like my granddad's bread pudding...Louis is an amazing chef....and I LOVE his bread pudding!!! Just remember it may be hard to find this place if you are driving in and not sailing in...but it's worth finding!"	1
"TITLE: How to ruin a great meal with bogus charges... | TEXT: Let me explain my 2-star ratings by listing the pros and cons of my experience. I dined here with my girlfriend for our anniversary and it was a mixed experience for sure.  Pros: the food and service (by Katie) were 5-star as both were excellent, some of the best tapas I've ever had. The entire 5-course meal was excellent.  Cons: 1) If you're going to order the 5-course or chef's tasting menu DO NOT make a later reservation. We came in at 8:30, ordered the 5-course option and by our 2nd course we were the only table left and the staff was cleaning up around us making us feel very uncomfortable, like we were holding them up from closing. 2) Review your bill VERY carefully because there will be odd charges on it. First off, we were charged $70 for a bottle of wine listed for $65 on the menu. Secondly, we were charged a $13 ""beverage tax"" on the alcohol. When I said to the manager, ""so between the sales tax and the beverage tax, you're taxing us twice on the alcohol, right?"" He replied ""yes"". The Phila. beverage tax is intended to sweetened drinks like soda, energy drinks, etc. and is NOT intended for alcohol. We dine in Phila all the time and we've NEVER been charged such a silly charge. We were also charged $8 for using a credit card (which was already on the bill before we even paid). What if we paid with cash? When I told the manager that it's illegal to charge a fee for using a debit card and showed him proof on my phone, he merely looked at me. So we basically paid an extra $25 for nonsense after dropping $250 there.   Will we go back? No we won't. As I said the meal and service were fantastic but feeling rushed when you've ordered a multi-course meal and then being nickel-and-dimed with illegal charges basically ruined an excellent meal and our anniversary dinner. This is especially disappointing given that this is a Townsend Wentz restaurant."	1
TITLE: Would NOT recommend | TEXT: Horrible service. Rude staff and manager. Would NOT recommend.   Additionally, my experience making a reservation was a nightmare. Book reservations with caution. I was charged $300 for a misunderstanding and a lack of clarification on Kann’s end.	0
TITLE: Birthday celebration! | TEXT: Read all the wonderful reviews so gave it a try. Went early as read there are always lines. Yup! Not early enough, so we sat at the bar which was perfect! The bar tender Scott was amazing, friendly, attentive and fun! Kept our wine glasses full! Food was fantastic! We were having such a great time I didn’t take any pictures until after. We’ll be back!! Highly recommend!	0
TITLE: Not what it used to be. | TEXT: Coquine used to be great restaurant with a relaxing neighborhood vibe. After two visits in the last year, we noticed it has become a snooty restaurant, with greedy prices and portions. The last time we went with family from out of town and they couldn't believe how ridiculous the wine portions were - they barely served us 4 ounces and charged $20 per glass. The food is still great, but it would help to lose the attitude and the greediness.	1
TITLE: Hidden gem with delicious flavors | TEXT: The place is tiny and unassuming. I was surprised that the chef both attended front of house and the (open) kitchen. The food and wine were delicious. The octopus was tender and perfectly seasoned. The fish main was perfectly cooked, although I felt the endives were a little too bitter. Dessert was light and refreshing. Food choices are a bit limited, but everything tried was really good. Service was friendly and attentive. So why 4/5? I think some kinks still need to be worked out. It would make sense to hire at least one waitstaff to better tend to the customers. Will be back!	1
TITLE: Simple Fresh Delicious | TEXT: Parking is good. Property is clean. Service friendly. Menu simple. Food is hot and fresh. Noise level medium to high. Prices fit what is served. Burgers fries onion rings shakes all good. Cooked to order served hot to the table. The area is nice and relaxing. Good value	1
TITLE: Isolated and enigmatic- a good addition to a 'Desert Castle' tour | TEXT: Not much to see and not a lot is known about the site. It is thought it was a caravanserai. While named 'Qasr' (castle) the towers are solid and the slits in the walls unsuitable for arrows but useful for ventilation. I visited as part of a tour group- one of 3 sites visited under the 'Desert Castles' label as half a day trip.  The ride from Amman to the Qasr/s is flat desert and military sites with the occasional camel to spot and the 'castles' are easily spotted from the road. Each has their own point of interest. You can explore the many rooms of the caravanserai, peek out into the desert, imagine the travellers who may have journied here, consider how different the location must have been in less arid days. A lonely location- not something to make a special trip to on its own, but as part of a tour of similar structures it is a nice day out.	0
TITLE: Quality food in a down at heel area. | TEXT: Pause Cafe was a surprise highlight on our whistle stop weekend break in New York. We arrived there 11.30am we both ordered the sandwiches, me chicken & avocado salad & my son had bbq chicken sandwich, we drank their lemonade. We sat outside, it was a beautiful sunny morning, the area does not look up to much. However the food was really tasty, very nicely presented and good value. We would both highly recommend Pause Cafe as a venue with good quality food.	0
TITLE: Perfect American breakfast joint | TEXT: Our first experience of an American breakfast and it did not disappoint.  Great location, great food and great service and the price was reasonable for what we ordered and for the ambience of the place.	0
TITLE: Disappointing!!! | TEXT: I wanted a side dish of hummus & pita.  Not possible, could only order flat bread with hummus & greens on top ($14).  There was Maybe 4 tablespoons of AWFUL tasting hummus on top of DRY, over cooked, stale flatbread (too tough to chew).  I ate most of the greens & left the rest.  Took a while to get my order before I had to dash back next door to the Crest to make it to a movie.  The gnocchi was DRY (packaged? 2 days old?) but the pesto sauce was good.  The ratatouille wasn't cooked enough. Not impressed.	1
TITLE: Do not go here | TEXT: They are so unfriendly and so stuck on themselves. We could not get out of our RV spot because the way they did the roads and they’re blaming us because we drove over the grass. We have a 45 foot coach and that’s the spot they put us in where we could not get out. The woman came out yelling at us screaming so unprofessional. There’s a kind way to handle things and there is a bad way to handle things and this woman handle things extremely poorly. They have all these rules here and I am so unhappy with this park I would keep going. There’s other nice parks in the Durango area.	1
TITLE: Not impressed | TEXT: I was expecting a great French Experience but instead was served average food by people whom appeared as they rather not be there.   Waited 10 min to be seated, despite having a booking, and as mentioned, service was slow.   Approximately 9 tables of 4 inside and about 4 outside.  3 full time people serving plus someone in the bar but not a happy crew.   And when the bill came, 20% tip was already calculated in.  Not the option provided to tip what you felt relevant. And then the audacity to suggest more.   I wouldn’t go back.	1
TITLE: Pretentious - Trying to be like Top Chef food and misses the mark. | TEXT: The chef tried very hard to be a Top Chef style chef mixing and maxing various flavors together, but badly missed the mark. Instead of complimentary flavorings and seasonings, each dish tasted like a jumble of mess. For example my escargot was in a sauce that totally hid the flavor of the snails and even the small surprise of sweet bread cubes was barely noticeable. My rib eye sauce completely hid the meat and even the four small but lovely sweetened carrots and the mushrooms were tasteless. The deserts were a mix of flavors that did nothing for each other. Even their popcorn cheese cake which sounded great was little more than a deconstructed mess. Not a single dish highlighted its main ingredient from the rib eye to rabbit to scallops to halibut. The additions subtracted and there were no clean flavors to be found anywhere.  Now we were a party of 6 and that means service will be a little slow, but it was more than a little slow and getting 5 of the 6 appetizers at once, but waiting 17 minutes for the 6th was inexcusable. It should have been comped. Everyone else was already done as my daughter-in-law insisted we not wait.  When you're spending close to $600 for dinner the servers should know who gets what, but they didn't, although at least for the main course, all came out at the same time.  Finally, they knew we were there for a birthday, but other than the server saying happy birthday nothing was forthcoming, not even a single candle on one of the desserts we all shared.  I couldn't possibly recommend the restaurant to anyone.	1
TITLE: Bad mussels ruin experience! | TEXT: This restaurant is in a beautiful area of SF!!!  Gorgeous old homes and buildings!  Amazing!!!    The service was very good and we loved that it is a tip free restaurant.  Awesome that they provide a great work environment for their employees.    The portions were huge!  Especially the pork chops!!!!  Also the cheese from the selection of 3 cheeses appetizers,  2 of the 3 were huge chunks of cheese.    Most of our food was amazing and very delicious.  But my sister and I had the PEI mussels that were very off and made me almost throw up.  We couldn’t eat them.  We told our waiter at the end of our meal, as he asked how the food was.  He told the cook and the cook said they were fresh, bought that day and tasted fine.  Too bad for us!  Charged full price .  Not that we were expecting them to remove the charge but since neither of us could eat them we would have thought there would have been more than a “too bad!”  It left our experience less that delightful.	1
TITLE: Romantic Dining | TEXT: The food here is exceptional, all their pastas are made in house. Everyone enjoyed their meals. My only negative comment is that the restaurant is located in a historic house and the rooms are tight. The chiavari chairs were not comfortable. Next time I will opt for the outdoor seating which looked delightful.	1
TITLE: Delicious dining in a cute cafe | TEXT: This little bustling French restaurant reminds me of a European Cafe. My friend and I so enjoyed our dinner at Le Pichet. We are vegetarians:  We had a mushroom crepe, an asparagus salad, and the seasonal dessert and were very happy.  The staff was very busy and very helpful. Because the cafe is very small, the diners sit very close to each other which makes it almost impossible to NOT have conversations with the next table. As visitors to Seattle, it was fun meeting the couple at the next table who lived there.	1
TITLE: A food lover treat ! | TEXT: I’m not sure where to start! This is an exceptional restaurant from all aspects. Mexican food with a twist! The creativity and innovation in each plate we tried was beyond expectations.  Lots of flavor with Mexican roots mixed and combined in a creative way.  A wonderful culinary experience that explains why this gem earned one star Michelin.  Needless to say that this restaurant is located in the vibrant coconut grove area. Staff was very friendly and service was great. Strongly recommended for food lovers!	0
TITLE: Trying the new place | TEXT: I love Italian food, so I finally got to visit this place. Owners are great and maybe I just was a little picky on this day but the bread seemed to be soaked in butter and there wasn't much garlic taste. The Caesar salad lacked something but the saving grace was the eggplant. I'll overlook the bread and salad and swear by the eggplant.	1
TITLE: delicious | TEXT: As a local, J. Alexander’s is delicious, dependable brand. Today, we had Asian chicken salads, a bottle of Chardonnay and the spinach queso dip. Everything was so good: food, presentation, staff, environment, wine, noise level, temperature - everything!	0
TITLE: Ignore the low ratings! | TEXT: The low avg rating isn’t correct in our opinion. A few things: - This isn’t a Mexican restaurant. It’s meso-American centered around different types of corn. The head chef and all the kitchen staff are Colombian. - As expected for a Michelin starred restaurant, it was very inventive and we found almost every dish incredible. The flavors were complex and the presentation was amazing. The only exception was one dish (the catch of the day), which was too salty in our opinion, but that was an outlier of the 8 dishes we tried. The highlights were the tacos al pastor, smoked trumpet mushrooms, crab arepa, and carnitas. - The service was on point. Quick, friendly, and knowledgeable.	1
TITLE: A must go place in San Francisco | TEXT: Very very interesting and creative menu, great wines, good service, nice atmosphere, great place to share plates and try new food combinations, much more interesting than the average restaurant menus	0
TITLE: Brunch Review Only | TEXT: This review is strictly about brunch. We paid $200 for two omelettes, two juices and two coffees. The service was good and the atmosphere was nice and it’s very pretty and the view are wonderful but honestly it’s breakfast. How on earth do you pay $200 for eggs? And the sides come out massive like you are at a steakhouse and a little overdone. We are staying in the hotel and it is a very nice place but I don’t think we would eat there again.	1
TITLE: Hard pass, good location | TEXT: Booked 4 nights stayed for 2. Have stayed in various HIE here and in Europe and you know going in the rooms will be smaller, basic but functional and nice. These rooms were small and considering it was renovated not functional at all. There are so many ways to maximize a small space but that was not done here. They were nice to let us see 2 other rooms and choose after our initial room. Good location, Front desk lady helpful and nice.	0
TITLE: Consistent excellence | TEXT: This was our third visit to this always busy restaurant. The food was again excellent. Our wait person was excellent and provided valuable advice. Every dish was special and will return again soon!	0
TITLE: Fantastic San Francisco Lunch Spot with Top-Notch Hospitality | TEXT: We came here with a large group to celebrate a team member's promotion, and even though we hadn't given the restaurant a heads-up (on a busy Friday as Fleet Week was kicking off, no less!), the owner and her team couldn't have been more accommodating.  The owner and her team welcomed us warmly, found space for our group, and made sure everyone was comfortable and well taken care of throughout the night. The service was attentive without being rushed, and you could tell they genuinely cared that we had a great experience.  They even brought out additional umbrellas and helped move them around to protect us from the bright sun that day.   The atmosphere was lively and inviting--exactly what you want for a celebration--and the scenery, with that one-of-a-kind San Francisco backdrop, made it even better. A big thank you to the staff and owner for turning what could've been a logistical headache into a wonderful, memorable lunch for our team! We'll definitely be back.	1
TITLE: World Traver favorite vacation | TEXT: I expected the scenery and the sites to be amazing, but was not prepared for the professionalism and passion of the staff!  Without exception all staff members engaged with participants to educate and make feel welcome!	0
TITLE: Excellent Dinner | TEXT: This is a large and first rate restaurant in the heart of downtown. My food was excellent-I had the Chipotle Honey Salmon and a side salad, and my cocktail was good and strong. Service was friendly and quick.  One note: I sat outside in decent weather and it was very nice.	1
TITLE: Downtown Take-Out | TEXT: I'm typically downtown in the late afternoon only a couple of times each year.  When that happens, I often stop at Yasoo Yani to bring food home.  The wait time is only about ten or fifteen minutes.  Food is hot, good, and not too expensive.  If you want Greek, this is definitely a good place to go.  Kabob wraps are very good, as well as the lemon-rice soup.  They did not include feta in my order, though, which I requested and paid for.	1
TITLE: The atmosphere was better than the food | TEXT: This restaurant was picked based on good reviews but those people must be more interested in the atmosphere than the food.  The location is good (though there is only paid parking nearby) and there are a lot of shops and restaurants that can be walked to from here.  It was lively but not too loud inside.   However, the food was rather expensive for what was received.  The food was good but not exceptional.  We ordered a pizza and the side of carrots.  The serving size of the pizza was good but the serving size of the carrots was small considering the $15 price tag on a side dish.	1
TITLE: Horrible | TEXT: Horrible waitress pushed me to get the most expensive plate that I didn’t want. Very rude about it. And said couldn’t change it cause food was already making it. Absolutely never again. Food was also ehh	1
TITLE: Great little find | TEXT: Great little bar tucked away behind shops but sign posted well 70s 80s music very friendly bar maid .great night and right next to our hotel. Would definitely recommend	0
TITLE: Try the Venison Chili | TEXT: I had a wonderful experience at Haywire. The staff was exceptionally friendly and polite, making me feel welcome from the moment I walked in. I tried the venison chili, which had the perfect amount of spice and was incredibly satisfying. I ordered the smaller cup was more than enough to fill me up. They certainly didn't skimp on the venison, which was tender and flavorful.	1
TITLE: Fantastic | TEXT: Great location and coffee. The owner is a friendly guy who loves to host his guests. The cafe has a nice atmosphere, with great art work around.	0
TITLE: Gem in Midtown. | TEXT: Excellent vegan tasting menu and I’m not Vegan! Friendly service.  Vegan and non vegan menu options.	0
TITLE: Skip Lenoir | TEXT: Take a pass on this venue. We had real looked forward to a very special, upscale, what a big disappointment. First although they said they had a dress code all staff were in jeans. I guess it was supposed to be eclectic but the interior seemed very tired. We wanted to try one of the menu items we saw online but all the menu was the same as the price fixed,but was restaurant week and the entree we wanted was not listed. To start they offered a  half glass of sparkling wine which we declined. My husband asked for Pinot Grigio but they didn't have it. I ordered a blonde in lilet and it arrived, not in the customary highball glass with a slice of orange but in a champagne glass with a slice of lemon. New to me. The crab fingers were good. The squash salad was too spicy and oily for me . The main course tritip  steak they charge $51 for on the menu  was so  tough! The sauce was delicious. The dessert of peaches and sort of a yogurt was overpowered by the mint. Needless to say that 9over $200 dinner could not hold a candle to the many restaurants we have been to in the last month.	1
TITLE: A Classic San Francisco Dining Experience | TEXT: We had a memorable dining experience with our friends.  We were greeted by name as we arrived for our reservation. Sherry ushered us to our table.  The wait staff was efficient, attentive, yet unobtrusive.  The Sommelier, Aaron recommended the wine pairings for our selected dinner menus (all different choices for the four diners). All the pairings were superb.  We truly enjoyed the meal and the wine.  I highly recommend this restaurant for a special occasion evening, or any evening when you want to have a memorable dining experience.	1
TITLE: Fabulous Happy Hour! | TEXT: Fabulous Happy Hour with many choices and great pricing. The food was so delicious! Our server Ana was the best-very attentive and friendly. It was a great choice while on our vacation.	0
TITLE: Dinner at The Dutch | TEXT: Since The Dutch moved closer to my home I was eagerly anticipating a meal in this wonderful location. And I was not disappointed in the least. Nor was my ever crankier partner, who has narrowed his range of acceptable food choices to only a few items; which makes dining out a bit tricky. This is a well done nicely thought out casual menu served up in a light filled corner location with lots of windows, perfect for people watching.   For dinner, our party of four started with 3 appetizers, charred shishito peppers, some truffled Parmesan fries and small bowl of pickled vegetables. All were perfect finger food bites to go along with some really stellar cocktails- loved the Singing Fountain. For entrees, a double cheeseburger proclaimed excellent., a generous entree sized Cobb salad, zucchini spaghetti primavera, a light offering of summers best veggies and a chicken gravy - a sort of savory Dutch baby with egg sauce etc. Two desserts of a blueberry tart and some malted milk ice cream with homemade peanut brittle,  completed  the evening along with some delicious coffee and espresso.  For dinner, with moderate drinking and three courses  I would figure on spending $60 -75 per person with tax and tip. Though it would be quite easy to have a lovely meal here for half that price.   We are all looking forward to our next visit for breakfast/lunch.	0
TITLE: A great lunch! | TEXT: We visit Portland a couple of times a year.  Our daughter brought us to the Observatory.  Everyone had a great lunch...that is a feat when EVERYONE at our table is happy!   The price was reasonable.  I highly recommend.	0
"TITLE: Very Nice Meal   A few small issues.... | TEXT: We met friends for lunch there yesterday and had a lovely time.   The server,  Steve,  was friendly and took good care of us.     There were some minor issues,  but we will definitely go here again.   Here are a couple of things that could have been better: We were shown to an area with booths  which is behind a divider.  Several of the tables along the wall have  very  little lighting -   I asked the lady who was seating us if we could sit at one of the other tables which was better lit,  and she was not particularly friendly about it.  I don't know why,  as there were several  available. Three of us got our drinks quickly, but one of us asked for a  Negroni.   That drink took a long time to prepare,  and  our wine orders were slow coming.    I  think this was down to the bar management,  not our server. I had flounder,  which was excellent.  My husband ordered a steak sandwich,  which he described as ""average."""	1
TITLE: Excellent but not a cheap date... | TEXT: Although their monthly menus are supposedly different, we found after checking their website for a number of months after dining that they were understandably quite similar. Nonetheless, we would expect the same high quality offerings on every menu. The dining experience, even for Seattle which has become overrated, was indeed excellent but not a cheap date. The fixed menu at $175 per person became substantially more costly after adding the recommended sake pairings. However, as you can see from the photos which we have chosen to post, that the sake selections were particularly memorable. Enjoy!	0
TITLE: Great lunch | TEXT: My wife ordered the fried green tomatoes for an appetizer, they were very good.  She ordered a hamburger with fried sweet potato fries, both were outstanding.  I ordered blackened shrimp with cheese grits and hushpuppies.  It was all delicious.  This was my first time eating here.  It will not be the last.  It was also served quickly.  Great job.	1
TITLE: The Jacksonville place for meat | TEXT: Great dinner overall very friendly wait staff, hostess, and gauchos. We have visited several different Brazilian Steakhouses in several different cities and this one ranks in the middle. The salad area is top notch with great salad options, meats and cheeses. The tableside  meats were good too although there were a couple meats that could've used a little more seasoning (pretty bland) and no one ever came around with any ribs and there are both pork and beef ribs on the menu. Other than that a good experience	1
TITLE: The waitress was great. The salad was tasty but they should call it asparagus salad not Nicoise! | TEXT: Their salad Niçoise salad. It had no tuna. It had crumbled eggs instead of sliced boiled eggs, little olives. The only nice thing was the pickled red onions and the asparagus. They claim they don’t add tuna because it’s a vegetarian restaurant but the sell duck ragu and bergers. Go figure!	1
TITLE: Good value, good breakfast | TEXT: A nice business hotel near Takamatsu station and art museum that is about a ten minute walk away.   Excellent breakfast brought to your room in the morning.   Laundry is on 8th floor via stairs from the 7th. 500 for wash and hr of drying.   Just missing charging plugs for electronics.   Lobby is on second floor.   Friendly and helpful staff.	1

The store manager came up to the register and told me he need to see my I.D. I told him why do you need to see my I.d. Yandi the manager said its for my protection to see my ID. I ask if this is store policy. The manager said yes its store policy to ask for I.D. for any thing over 50.00 dollars. I said im almost 50 years old and Ive eating at Mc Donalds all my life and ive never heard of Mc Donald asking me for I.D. The manager was rude, argument, and nasty. I ask to see the store policy. He refuse. I told the manager that I bet your policy only applies to people that looks like us. 345 NE Second Ave Miami Flordia 33132 02-05-22. 10:05am number 307 Please review camera asap	1
TITLE: Loved it! | TEXT: Delicious food along with reasonable prices and fast and friendly service! Can't wait to go back and try other entrees.	1
TITLE: A great place for a celebration or a night out with family | TEXT: This is a great spot for a locally sourced, delicious meal with lots of menu options in Dallas. It’s worth a stop if you’re visiting from out of town and looking for a family friendly, reasonably priced, unique dining experience. Celebration has been a local favorite for years, and we love trying the specials as well as eating from their standard menu. Their salads are always  fresh, the tea is strong and fresh brewed, and there is a good selection of entrees providing choices for everyone. The restaurant itself is quaint with photos on the walls depicting various stages of their history. There a little mini dining rooms with several booths and tables as they have had several space add-ons over the years. Definitely recommend stopping here if you haven’t already!	1
TITLE: Awesome Restaurant—a Must go | TEXT: Must admit it was a little noisy but the Atmosphere is lively, busy and bustling and we enjoyed the vibes. Sat at the bar. Barrett was great bartender. Offered great menu suggestions. Food was phenomenal and included raw oysters, catfish, crab claws, capellini and crab, and tuna crudo.  Mother of Pearl cocktail paired nicely with our food. Strongly recommend and Definitely plan on returning.	1
TITLE: Learning at the Warren G. Harding Presidential Sites | TEXT: Great trip. We arrived at approximately 9:30 am and made our way towards the entrance of the museum. After paying the admission fee, we received a quick overview of the site and went on our way. We opted to view some of the outdoor exhibits first, which included the guard house and press house. The press house contained multiple informational plaques about President Hardings wife and her contributions to society. After viewing the press house, we made our way to the front porch of the house, where we waited for the 10 am guided hour tour to begin. There were guided tours of the presidents former house being held every hour throughout the day. The guided tour of the house was very informational, and the tour guide took us from room to room, while pointing out interesting features and artifacts out for display. The tour guide told us several personal stories related to the Hardings time at the house. The guided tour lasted roughly 1 hour.  After viewing the house, we went back inside to view the main exhibits. We opted to watch a short documentary about President Hardings life and some of the trials and tribulations he faced during his time as President. There were multiple informational plaques out for display, many of them quite text heavy, that went into detail about Hardings upbringing and roots as the owner of a newspaper company in Marion. The plaques also talked about election day, and several of the policy’s Harding implemented while in office. The last section of the museum dealt with his death and some controversial issues that surrounded his presidency. There were multiple artifacts out for display in the museum, along with short video clips that related to President Harding's time in office.  Tip: I recommend spending 3 hours here if you truly want to see everything.	0
TITLE: Standard | TEXT: We were seated quickly and the server was nice.  Very tasty cheese wontons, otherwise, for me the buffet was just ok...maybe I wasn't in the mood for it that day.  Husband enjoyed it more than I did, so we will return.	1
TITLE: Delish | TEXT: Tugce was amazing (our server). I highly recommend the garlic bread (big surprise), pizza, oysters, and shrimp cocktail. All was sooo good!	0
TITLE: Geat experience from now on I will call my husband Biggles! | TEXT: My husband has always wanted to fly in a Spitfire but too costly, so we booked for him to try the simulator experience. He loved every minute of it! I enjoyed just watching and filming him. It cost £60 for the hour and was worth every penny. Many thanks to Colin who talked my husband through all the proceedures, I won't be surprised if we are going back again soon, it was brilliant!	1
TITLE: 😕 | TEXT: So disappointed.  I brought my daughter here because I thought everything was fabulous before covid.  Unfortunately, nothing was amazing.   We ordered the Brussels sprouts for the appetizer and the raviolis and steak salad.    The Brussels sprouts did not have a lot of flavor.   The descriptions for the raviolis sounded amazing with the ingredients of beef, ricotta and honey.   I detected no ricotta or honey and all we received were 4 squares of ravioli for $26!   The salad was described as having blue cheese, pears, candied hazelnuts and onions.  This was a $25 salad.  The steak was very small and barely any toppings.   It's really too bad.	1
TITLE: Beautiful rooms in excellent location | TEXT: We spend two nights as a weekend trip and are absolutley satisfied with the friendly host, big rooms,with balconee and fridge, fast wifi and a tasty breakfast buffet.  The location in the middle of serfaus is super, and as it is not located at the main street it is also quite.	1
TITLE: Delicious Breakfast | TEXT: I had a great breakfast here! I got the shrimp and grits and it was delicious! It was nice and hot temperature wise! The service was also great! Sarah was my server and she went above and beyond! I can’t wait to return when I visit Dallas again!	0
TITLE: “Like a Chili’s” | TEXT: We went here because it had pretty good reviews and I would say we found it to be average. The host said that of the hotel restaurants this one was like a “chilis” vs the steakhouse being like a “Ruth’s Chris”. That set the tone for us to expect average. Our waiter was very good and attentive. The restaurant has several different areas for seating and we were near the outdoor bar.  I would not go back.	0
TITLE: Left in 30 minutes | TEXT: VERY loud with tables literally about 4-6 inches apart.  You could hear everything neighboring tables were saying but very little of your partner's comments.  I like a dry white wine with Mediterranean food but none available (excluding two bubbly options). Only one vodka brand available so you are limited to cocktails (mainly rum) or beer. While we left in about 30 minutes, flat bread pizza was overcooked by had good flavors and the octopus was tough but again, had a nice flavor.  Big crowd so appears popular, but we will not go back - too many other great options out there.	1
TITLE: A clean room to stay in | TEXT: I always trust Wyndham and for good reasons. The hotel was very well kept. Very clean room. The front dest staff were very sweet and helpful and they were very attentive during breakfast. Definitely recommend it.	0
TITLE: Authentic Greek Food | TEXT: This is a large restaurant been in Stockton for a long time. The food is always good very fresh, very authentic Greek food. The service is very fast and attentive, its only open for lunch but during the week is a very busy place with all the business around. There is parking in the back and the restaurant will validate your ticket. It is a very good value for your money.	1
TITLE: Most enjoyable evening! | TEXT: Loved this place. Beautiful space, efficient, friendly, upscale service, good food—somethings were outstanding, others just ok. The menu is incredibly varied and original. It’s prix fixe, but gives you several options to choose from. Portions are generous and they keep bringing you little extras, so pace yourself!	1
TITLE: Conveniently near hotel | TEXT: We came here for a light dinner after check-in at the Marriott Residence Inn right across the street. Liked the clean exterior curb appeal. There were patio seatings. The interior with high ceiling was welcoming. We settled into a quiet, comfortable booth in one section of the spacious dining room. Enjoyed the draft BlueMoon. The dishes we ordered: Mac & cheese, cornbread, onion soup, Caesar, poached salmon spinach salad, mixed green salad, and shrimp scampi were all quite average. Service was good.	0
TITLE: Nice bar/restaurant right on Bourbon | TEXT: We really liked this place.  We didn't eat there, but it was a great bar/restaurant right on Bourbon where you could watch football without the overpowering music.  The staff and manager were great to talk with.	0
TITLE: Sushi! | TEXT: If you love sushi then you’ll love Cocoro!  Great and Authentic sushi and Japanese cuisine for anyone who loves this type of food, can’t go wrong!	0
TITLE: Don't do it | TEXT: Overpriced and underwhelming! Service was ok but the food was less than mediocre.  My son and I had nachos and a couple of Philly cheesesteaks.  The bill was $100 after tip.  Yikes! Never again...	0
TITLE: Great food, great staff and a different experience! | TEXT: There were 4 of us and one person could not tolerate garlic and our server really helped to determine the dishes that were free of it and which ones could be modified. I knew we were in a great restaurant ! Lots in the menu to choose from and the concept was to share the plates. We decided to do that but we also chose to have one as our main dish each. All the dishes were fantastic and too many to individually comment on. My main was the black cod and it was very good. I also had a bite of the pork chop and it was rich in flavour, moist and actually heavenly.  Overall a great culinary outing ! Well done!	1
TITLE: Great hotel stay! | TEXT: Microtel is conveniently located near Mohegan Sun casino.  The hotel is quiet, very clean and comfortable. Staff are always friendly.	0
TITLE: You just have to see the sign in person! | TEXT: This is literally a small restaurant with a BIG sign! Allow 30-60 min if you plan to eat. Everyone was very friendly. Note: There is no gift shop here. Just a couple of showcases with merch!	1
TITLE: Delicious and delightful | TEXT: We dined outside in the courtyard which was delightful on a beautiful August night. Our waiter was very attentive without being intrusive. The dishes come out at a leisurely pace so don’t be in a hurry. My white was picked by my server and was spectacular. The sourdough bread was great. I lived the pasta duet starter. We both had filets which were so tender and perfectly cooked.	1
TITLE: Peace in the Hills | TEXT: A lovely place to stay for anyone wanting complete peace and tranquility. The rabbits and wallabies at dawn and dusk added to the feeling of being well away from civilisation while Kettering was just down the hill.	0
TITLE: Stick to the ribs brunch but inconsistent | TEXT: Came here for weekend brunch.  Right in the heart of east passyunk, it’s a popular place. Its theme is Amish influence which is nice for brunch.  On the one hand. My Amish bologna eggs Benedict with cream chip beef and was super yummy and our lattes were perfect.  But my wife’s Avacado toast was really too basic for the price.  Also the service felt young and untrained and very inconsistent.  So we drop a star for that inconsistency.	1
TITLE: LOVE THIS PLACE | TEXT: Its a great place, great food, great atmosphere!  I love sitting outside on a Saturday or Sunday morning and enjoy my French Toast and a cup of coffee or a mimosa.  I like to sit and watch the boats, it is so relaxing!	0
TITLE: Friendly Restaurant | TEXT: My wife, son and I came to Marianna for. Marathon. My son’s first. We needed pasta the night before. Not many options for Italian in Marianna.  Tried Pennelo’s and were extremely happy. Pasta sauce had a great flavor. Salad was crisp and fresh. New York Cheesecake was perfect texture. Plan to run the marathon here next year and will choose Penello’s again	1
TITLE: Well preserved | TEXT: A nice little building out in the middle of nowhere. It was quite complete with a ground floor and courtyard and a story above that with rooms you could go in. It’s astonishing how old it is and it is one of the best preserved of the desert castles. You can only get there by car, lots of hotels do tours from Amman.	0
TITLE: Excellent cocktails | TEXT: Came here around 4:30 on a Saturday to take advantage of the 4-6 happy hour. Perhaps it was the early hour or the fact that there seems to be a cocktail/brewery/wine bar on every corner but other than two other couples it was empty. All the better for us!  Our server was friendly and helpful. I had the Pine Street Sour and the Lagunita cocktails.  Both were tasty and refreshing. My husband and I shared the potato and leek croquettes and the slider. Both were delicious. We enjoy trying new places when we travel which often means repeat trips to the same place don't happen often but we will definitely return here in the future.	0
TITLE: Worth visiting | TEXT: We are regular visitors to the resort but had never had a meal at this restaurant before. As we were staying at the accommodation this time, we naturally tried the food.  We were not disappointed. The portions are generous and the quality outstanding.	1
TITLE: How to say something nice ?? | TEXT: Just OK at the Best Ordered a Beer and got Pig Ears Reordered drinks  Before dinner drinks The drinks arrived after dinner Food  Ok … Not Great Or Outstanding  Waste of time and money for a mediocre meal Will not be back Thank you for reading Bob😀	1
TITLE: Awesome Buffalo Chicken nachos | TEXT: First visit and definitely not the last. We never went here because our thinking was it was just like all the other wings chains with a similar name. WRONG. We like this place. It will be a regular place for us. The nachos were so good - with real chicken. My husband got a burger. He is very picky about burgers but said he liked it and would order again. We sat at the bar and had a good time talking with Sarah. She made our visit fun.	1
TITLE: Services! | TEXT: This is a must go to restaurant. The service is excellent. All the waiter and waitress’s helping each other. The food was so good. It’s beautiful place along with outstanding services. I set back and watch how everyone help each other. From taking dishes out each other hand, off tables that didn’t belong to them. It was like a well rehearse play. Great job everyone!	1
TITLE: Waiter | TEXT: Jake was a fantastic waiter.  We usually look forward to George.  In this case Jake was a pleasant replacement.  Food always excellent.  We have been coming here since Fare opened.  A fantastic neighborhood restaurant.  A must “give it a try”.	0
TITLE: Get the shrimp and grits | TEXT: We visited on a Wednesday evening in November and it wasn't busy.  We had the best shrimp and grits.  Full of delicious flavor and large shrimp.  Good service and live music.  I wish I had more room to try the pie.  Next time!	0
TITLE: Wide range of excellent wines | TEXT: One of the things my wife and I like about Herzog Winery is that they make a wide range of wines, all of which are good, and at a wide range of prices.  The range of wines allows a different tasting experience each time we visit.  On this visit, we particularly liked the Sauvignon Blanc, which is not sharp, and the Choreograph, which is a field blend of ten varietals, but the Malbec was among the best wines we've tasted -- and we've tasted in over 200 wineries in eight states.  Occasionally we encounter a wine that evokes an intense pleasurable response, and this Malbec was one of those.  It would be hard to find a better wine at the price, and it would be even harder to find a better wine at twice the price.  Note that the winery is closed on Saturdays for religious observance, but it's worth the effort to fit it into the schedule on another day.	1
TITLE: FRESH SUSHI | TEXT: Fabulous family owned restaurant, has been in the village for many years.  Wonderful variety of food, all of it well done and fresh.  My ONLY go to place in the area.  Highly recommend!!	0
TITLE: A big disappointment | TEXT: The food was acceptable, but nothing memorable. We ordered three portions of black caviar, yet what we received were small sandwiches with only a couple of grains of black caviar on each; the rest was red caviar. The staff explained that they were “almost out” of black caviar, but we were still charged the full price. We chose not to make a scene at the time, though in hindsight, we should have said something.	1
"TITLE: How to ruin a great meal with bogus charges... | TEXT: Let me explain my 2-star ratings by listing the pros and cons of my experience. I dined here with my girlfriend for our anniversary and it was a mixed experience for sure.  Pros: the food and service (by Katie) were 5-star as both were excellent, some of the best tapas I've ever had. The entire 5-course meal was excellent.  Cons: 1) If you're going to order the 5-course or chef's tasting menu DO NOT make a later reservation. We came in at 8:30, ordered the 5-course option and by our 2nd course we were the only table left and the staff was cleaning up around us making us feel very uncomfortable, like we were holding them up from closing. 2) Review your bill VERY carefully because there will be odd charges on it. First off, we were charged $70 for a bottle of wine listed for $65 on the menu. Secondly, we were charged a $13 ""beverage tax"" on the alcohol. When I said to the manager, ""so between the sales tax and the beverage tax, you're taxing us twice on the alcohol, right?"" He replied ""yes"". The Phila. beverage tax is intended to sweetened drinks like soda, energy drinks, etc. and is NOT intended for alcohol. We dine in Phila all the time and we've NEVER been charged such a silly charge. We were also charged $8 for using a credit card (which was already on the bill before we even paid). What if we paid with cash? When I told the manager that it's illegal to charge a fee for using a debit card and showed him proof on my phone, he merely looked at me. So we basically paid an extra $25 for nonsense after dropping $250 there.   Will we go back? No we won't. As I said the meal and service were fantastic but feeling rushed when you've ordered a multi-course meal and then being nickel-and-dimed with illegal charges basically ruined an excellent meal and our anniversary dinner. This is especially disappointing given that this is a Townsend Wentz restaurant."	1
TITLE: Avoid avoid | TEXT: Not good. One employee is host/server/bartender and most of the time was nowhere to be found. The bar was out of tonic. My avocado toast was basically a brick topped with that avocado stuff that is squeezed out of a tube and a few cherry tomato halves. Awful. Husband’s burger came with cheese even though he ordered it without cheese. No one to ask to fix it, so I walked back to the kitchen door and tried to call to someone. No answer. A long time after that, the host/server/bartender finally emerged and took care of it. As we tried to pay the bill, we were told that the restaurant doesn’t take Visa. Wyndham can do better than that.	1
TITLE: Perfect Spot in Rittenhouse SQ | TEXT: Food was exceptional. Staying in Center City / Rittenhouse SQ and Google Best Restaurants near me turns up lots of options. This place did not disappoint. Fig & Ricotta salad plus their Rotolo pasta dish were just right. Certainly give them a try. Had no reservation, I just sat at a bar side table, it was a Sunday however.	1
TITLE: Great food | TEXT: We arrived at 5:15pm and were surprised that the place was entirely empty.  Thought maybe we had made a poor selection and that the vacant diner was a bad omen.  NOPE:  within minutes the place was so packed there wasn't a vacant seat!  Lucky to have parked when we did. We both had the Mediterranean Salad (split one between us) and the Baked Salmon with Brussels Sprouts and Roasted Potatoes.  Fabulous and flavorful!!  Then enjoyed a simple scoop of vanilla ice cream for dessert and off to the concert. I'd definitely go again!	0
TITLE: Wonderful dining experience! | TEXT: My husband and I dined at Contessa during a recent weekend in Boston. We stayed in the Newbury, so it was very convenient. We were seated next to a window where we had an amazing city view. Their butternut squash carpaccio was one of the best dishes I ever had. I enjoyed it so much that I failed to take a photo! My branzino was also very good and my husband enjoyed his lobster pasta. Overall, it was a fabulous dining experience!	0
TITLE: Unsavory Boia De | TEXT: Disappointing experience at Boia De.  We were looking forward to eating here.  My husband's parpadelle alla lepre was average, my  scallops sott-olio were tepid, not savory to the taste.  We did have a great bottle of wine from their wine list while we waited and enjoyed the chicken liver & foie gras pate, but this is not a Michelin star restaurant.   We are foodies and have had great meals here and abroad.  This was substandard, not worthy of a visit..	1
TITLE: Cosy and perfect | TEXT: Great avocado toast, hot chocolate to die ! The bagels too are good! We would be back again! The washroom too was very clean and beautifully decorated. Yes, we noticed ;)	1
TITLE: What a place!  Michelin star worthy | TEXT: The culinary experience that we had at Georgie’s was absolutely spectacular.  From the greeting of the hostess to leaving the restaurant was 5 star.  The tuna tataki and French onion consommé were phenomenal starters.   I had the strip steak and my wife had the tortellini and they both were phenomenal.  We finished with the tart tartin and candy bar for dessert.  The depth of flavor that Curtis Stone has developed with his dishes is better than most Michelin star restaurants I have dined at.  Keep up the good work and we’re looking forward to seeing you again in the future.	1
TITLE: Excellent experience and food at Spears | TEXT: Spears Restaurant is one of a kind.  The owner and cook serves the best fried pork chops we have ever had.  His fresh hand cut french fries are excellent.  We have been there 3 times and each time it has been excellent.  We make extra effort to pass thru Marianna on our way to Southern Florida and stop at Spears when he is open.  We hope to be there next Friday, March 15, 2024.  We have told many of our friends of our great experiences at Spears and recommend they go there when passing thru the area.	0
TITLE: Visiting Philly for first time bad experience at restaurant | TEXT: I visited Philly for the first time apparently this restaurant has a dress code. I was told I couldnt be seated because my pants were considered sporty. The hostess suggested I go shopping and purchase new pants. In terms of customer service this restaurant gets an F. The hostess could have handled the situation better. She could have apologized for the confusion and offered for me to return the next day. She was very dismissive no type of compromise. A deer without headlights. Its a shame as a black owed business and a person of color myself that is the experience I had. I would never recommend this restaurant to anyone that is visting Philly.	1
TITLE: Best Chain Wing Restaurant | TEXT: Always satisfied with the wings!! Always fresh, never dry, and plenty of sauce!! Custom service is also a 5 star.	0
TITLE: Great Breakfast Spot | TEXT: Our favorite neighborhood breakfast place has reopened!!!  Our breakfasts were delicious and service was fantastic.	0
TITLE: Quaint and Homey - good deal if you don't demand luxury | TEXT: The place is privately owned by the family which resides on premise. They are warm and helpful. The rooms are large, yet a bit outdated. It is well located in the center of town. It could use help with the upkeep but other than that it is a great place for the price. They also offer a good price on buffet & entertainment. The price includes breakfast.	0
TITLE: Clam chowder not what you'd expect | TEXT: Clam chowder was a red based chowder kind of a hot spicy stew. Not what we expected clam chowder to be  Food was good but expensive and small. Also service was slow.  Waitress was distracted just a few waitresses for a crowd. It's not a very big place. Probably only a dozen tables if you don't eat outside.   Try the palm fish camp about a mile away. It's excellent.	1
TITLE: Fine dining excellence | TEXT: Amazing dining experience from the drinks we had to start all the way to the decadent desert... flawless! We can't wait to return.	0
TITLE: Neighborhoody Sports Bar | TEXT: I like the neighborhoody feel and the large-screen TV’s to watch sports.  I was admittedly disturbed that one of the large screens was showing Fox News (this is a sports bar, for one thing!).  The Buffalo wings are okay, but I would t say great.  Service was very good late at night.	1
TITLE: Great place for drinks and dining. | TEXT: Great place for happy hour. Visited several times while in Portland. Great drinks, great food, great service, and wonderful views of the city.	0
TITLE: Mersea Magic!! | TEXT: Great tasty food, spectacular venue!!! MeeSun and staff are fantastic and so friendly!! It’s a family atmosphere. Outdoor spaces for the kids, bocci ball courts, putting green. Best view of SF, the hidden gem!! Take the Ferry from SF Ferry Building (10 minute ride) walk to Mersea. Take the ferry back to SF and call it a night or continue the party!!	0
TITLE: An wonderful experience | TEXT: A wonderful experience. It is very expensive, but you know that before you get there. We had the abridged menu; couldn’t eat a 10 course meal and would not want to pay the much   But the meal was fantastic and the friendliest, most helpful wait service. The wagyu was the best ever.  And the desserts were extremely good and different. If you want an excellent, interesting meal and can afford it, go there.	0
TITLE: Learning at the Warren G. Harding Presidential Sites | TEXT: Great trip. We arrived at approximately 9:30 am and made our way towards the entrance of the museum. After paying the admission fee, we received a quick overview of the site and went on our way. We opted to view some of the outdoor exhibits first, which included the guard house and press house. The press house contained multiple informational plaques about President Hardings wife and her contributions to society. After viewing the press house, we made our way to the front porch of the house, where we waited for the 10 am guided hour tour to begin. There were guided tours of the presidents former house being held every hour throughout the day. The guided tour of the house was very informational, and the tour guide took us from room to room, while pointing out interesting features and artifacts out for display. The tour guide told us several personal stories related to the Hardings time at the house. The guided tour lasted roughly 1 hour.  After viewing the house, we went back inside to view the main exhibits.

TITLE: Unable to gain access to the church | TEXT: We were not able to enter the church. The campanile is historically important since it was built in 1833, the first year that Christians were allowed to replace or rebuild their churches.	0
TITLE: Definitely recommend | TEXT: Stop here when visiting Philly. Large variety of foods to choose from. Plenty of shop to look for souvenirs. Definitely with visiting especially if it’s your first time visiting.	0
TITLE: Poor business practices. | TEXT: Went in for lunch. Person behind bar told us 20 minute wait. 3/4 of restaurants empty. Ignored us. Just left. Can find another place easily. At least sit us down with drinks.	1
"TITLE: Wonderful Happy Hour at Bellevue! | TEXT: Very elegant setting with welcoming and attentive servers.  The happy hour wine, crispy Brussel sprout medley, Parmesan truffle fries were all delicious!  Background music streaming from Spotify - various artists ""Summer Barbeque""  was so much fun families of multiple generations felt compelled to jive along !  Please view the submitted photos that capture the essence of the lovely XIX BAR LOUNGE."	0

TITLE: If You Love Salt... | TEXT: The atmosphere?  Great!  Service? Exceptional!  Cleanliness?  Terrific!  The food?  SALTY!!  Overly so too.  The queso was the best part of the whole meal.  Could've been an off night but we were disappointed...	1
TITLE: Truly Outstanding Beef | TEXT: This was our second trip to Miami and our second time dining here. We greatly enjoyed our pre-dinner cocktails, served by Marshall (a delightful bar tender who shared some great information about the city). For dinner, we had the sliced sirloin Wagyu and the sliced Wagyu filet mignon. Both were some of the very best meat we have ever had. While pricey, I can honestly say it was worth the cost.	0
TITLE: Delicious dining experience with friends | TEXT: This restaurant was recommended by friends.  A group of us went here for dinner on a Friday night.  This is a byob so we had brought some wine with us. This is a small restaurant but we were able to get seated.   We started with the bistro southeast salad and the Thai chili and Spicy curry wings both of which were excellent.  The wings were Korean style and the salad was served with house made dressing available for purhase.   We shared the seafood combination which was crawfish, fish, clams and lobster boil served with corn and potatoes.  Overall a great experience we will be back soon.	0
TITLE: Great Evening | TEXT: We have been here a few times and always enjoy our evening.  This time we came for an anniversary and it was special.  Great food.  Great Service.  No complaints about the most important elements of a restaurant.  My only small issue (and cause for four rather than five stars) is the proximity of the tables.   There were two tables on either side that were extremely close so that we had to listen to the conversations of both parties all night.  Not perfect for an anniversary situation.	1
TITLE: Fabulous Super Stupendous | TEXT: This restaurant is nothing but amazing. There are no other words. The tasting menu was full of foods that I would not typically eat yet I ate everything, In fact I relished everything. The subtle lasting taste of each course was memorable, and the transition to dessert was also quite impressive. The food was absolutely sumptuous. We were fortunate enough to have a very experienced server and he was also terrific. At one point my wife and I were not quite sure about one of the courses and the waiter very clearly said, try it, and if you still don’t like it, we will find something else. We tried it and we loved it. Every course was better than the next. Bravo!	1
TITLE: Trying the new place | TEXT: I love Italian food, so I finally got to visit this place. Owners are great and maybe I just was a little picky on this day but the bread seemed to be soaked in butter and there wasn't much garlic taste. The Caesar salad lacked something but the saving grace was the eggplant. I'll overlook the bread and salad and swear by the eggplant.	1
TITLE: Delicious | TEXT: So glad we stopped when passing through. Everything we ordered was delicious and the chowder was amazing. Will be back for sure.	0
TITLE: AWFUL | TEXT: I just left Ellen's and might I say it was the worst meal I have EVER had.  I am sure this review will fall on blind eyes and deaf ears. The food came out to fast and as I was looking at it I could tell it was NOT fresh.  When I told the waitress the biscuit was cold she gave me another COLD one.  The hash browns were cold and the the I know had been sitting there for awhile.  it looked pre made. When I got the new plate they just heated everything up in the microwave and by now everything was very rubbery.  I will not be returning to Ellen's,	1
TITLE: Limited and extremely overcooked food | TEXT: There is little to choose from at this restaurant. The majority of the food had been there awhile or it was entirely overcooked. The only things I found that were worth eating were the green beans and the imitation crab. We will not be returning to this establishment.	1
TITLE: Incredible experience | TEXT: What an incredible experience! There were flavors I'd never tasted before and everything they brought to us was delicious. Go hungry, because they bring an extraordinary amount of food. Our server was well-informed and prompt, and the service was very good. The braised lamb shoulder is their signature dish and should not be missed. I'd rank this among the top five meals I've had in my life.	1
TITLE: Quiet Oasis on the river-front and Exceptional Service | TEXT: We stayed at this lovely, relaxing and unassuming hotel for 3 days and could not fault the exceptional service provided by all the staff, especially the main host Hemasiri who always presented with a smile, was honest, super friendly, warm and helpful. No request went unheeded and the rooms are well sized, comfortable and cleaned to a high standard.  Although a few general updates wouldn’t go astray, the hotel grounds with the river front felt like a tropical oasis away from the hustle and bustle of life. The lunch and breakfast portions were huge and delicious.   Hotel Hemadan  is outstanding value for money and a hidden gem. We hope to return in the not too distant future.	1
TITLE: GREAT DAME OF BROAD STREET | TEXT: This restaurant was our go-to for Thanksgiving, prior to the pandemic. Every year, we would come for the luscious all-you-can-eat buffet. This year, we returned & it was great to be back! As always, the food was outstanding. (This year, they even had a duo that provided live instrumental music.)   We did encounter an issue with seating. We asked to be moved to a different room & our request was denied. A screaming baby kept us from fully enjoying the experience.	1
TITLE: Best Italian in JAX | TEXT: Fresh pasta, fresh baked bread, amazing Italian wine list and delicious food!  I recommend the fresh fish prepared 11 ways, Livornese is my favorite!	0
"TITLE: French Classic Intimate Ambiance | TEXT: We've been meaning to come here for a while and finally made the leap. So glad we did!  We figured the only way to better understand San Francisco's culinary fine dining history was to trace it right back near the start.  Chef Gary Danko was among the early wave of James Beard Award winning chefs in San Francisco and later became part of the first generation of Michelin-starred chefs in the city once the Michelin Guide began rating San Francisco restaurants.   I've read some Yelp reviews calling his food ""old school"". After our experience there, I'd say it's more of a throwback to the golden age of fine dining. You won't find trendy hyper-local experimental cuisine with designer eatable floral pedals in mini Japanese pottery and expensive foam that pretends to be flavor. Instead you'll find a rolling cheese cart, white tablecloths, impeccable service and sauces that use classic French techniques (béarnaise, fumets, veloutés). All paying homage to classic French cooking.   The menu offers 3, 4, or 5-course prix‑fixe menu with ample choices in each category.  We chose the 3 and 4.   We enjoyed every dish.   Stand Outs:  Roast Lobster with Potato Purée, Edamame, Peas, Asparagus, and Tarragon Jus - Tender lobster, nicely seasoned and comforting potato purée and velvety tarragon jus.  The Glazed Oysters with Osetra Caviar. So good! I could've eaten 3 more. Plump perfectly cooked oysters topped with a generous amount of Osetra caviar nestled in a silky leek fondue and a light lettuce cream. Buttery but not rich and with a wonderful briny ocean finish.   Filet of Beef with Potato Gratin, King Trumpet Mushrooms. Tender and juicy that paired perfectly with the bone marrow béarnaise.   The Horseradish Crusted Salmon: We had questions - how is a ""horseradish"" crust so airy and fluffy? Then we consulted with our server who spilled the beans. It's the Egg Whites folded in with the horseradish.  Add a tangy grain mustard sauce to balance the rich salmon, and you've got an old-school French combo. IMHO, in today's flavor landscape, mustard doesn't get enough love.   Let's talk dessert!!  Pastry Chef Killian Guillotin grew up in Brittany, France, and  cut his teeth in top French kitchens before sharing his magic here.   The Baked Chocolate Soufflé with two sauces. Light as a cloud with just enough rich-sweetness to say dessert's in the house. And don't get me started with the vanilla bean crème anglaise and Belgian chocolate sauces. Worth every calorie!!  Is Gary Danko old school? Maybe. But in the way your favorite vintage wine is old. Complex, full bodies, and full of finesse .   Happy Eating!!"	1
"TITLE: The place to Stay in san Quirico... | TEXT: By that I mean that it is the ONLY place to stay in the village. We weep on a walking tour so only stayed the one night. Rooms are quiet and big but the beds are below par. We had a terrace but the access to it was covered in pigeon poo so I don't think anyone had been in the room for weeks. On the shower there is an odd plastic plate, take this out before showering, it is deadly! We ate down stairs and it was very nice. Breakfast was ""OK"""	1
TITLE: A food lover treat ! | TEXT: I’m not sure where to start! This is an exceptional restaurant from all aspects. Mexican food with a twist! The creativity and innovation in each plate we tried was beyond expectations. Lots of flavor with Mexican roots mixed and combined in a creative way. A wonderful culinary experience that explains why this gem earned one star Michelin. Needless to say that this restaurant is located in the vibrant coconut grove area. Staff was very friendly and service was great. Strongly recommended for food lovers!	0
"TITLE: Worth the visit!!! | TEXT: I was very impressed with the Warren G. Harding Presidential Sites.  We took the tour of his house, and listened first hand from the tour guides all about when Harding gave speeches on the ""front porch"".  The house is stunning and is 90+ percent original from years ago when Warren and his wife Florence lived in the house.  The tour guides can answer any questions you have off the top of their heads.  The  Library & Museum was finished in the spring of 2021 and they have a nice gift shop in there too.  They spared no expense in the construction of the building - it is beautiful!!!!  If you are a history buff, this is a must do."	1
TITLE: Too expensive for what you get! | TEXT: For context, we have eaten at several of the top ranked restaurants in the world.  We’re very familiar with the idea of tasting menus.  The staff at the restaurant (ie. Valet, hostess, waiter, etc.) were all very good.  The artistry of the food was good.  The food quality was good.  The menu variety was good.  Having said that, the pace was a bit too slow and not because it was busy.  The major negative critique was that the food quantity was severely lacking.  After spending a few hundred on dinner, I left starving.  The same family owns other restaurants in Jax, one we really enjoy, but I would not recommend this one.  Way too expensive for what you get.	1
TITLE: Very disappointed, not worth the trip | TEXT: We went for a birthday celebration and was very disappointed in the slow service and lack of knowledge of the server. order chilled seafood platter, steak and lobster and oyster rock fellows, the steak came first and waited a while before the chilled seafood plater came out and the oyster appetizer never came before our meals. the oysters on the chilled plate had lots of sand and shells in it and the steak was so so. The manager asked how your dinner was and told him of the problems and he did not say sorry or make any adjustment. All in all very disappointed birthday celebration	1
TITLE: Disappointment for date night | TEXT: Disappointment. Tasting menu with great wine and terrible service. One entire dish was a huge miss. Does not happen at places deemed to be “future Michelin star” restaurants.	0

TITLE: One of our favorite spots in Philly! | TEXT: We live 50 miles from Philly. We were going to be in town for a show at the Walnut Street Theatre, celebrating our anniversary. I made reservations at Talula's Garden due to it's proximity to the theater. I believe this was our third or fourth time dining there. I had the Roasted Chicken with Gnocchi and my wife had the Handmade Ricotta Ravioli. To say they were both good would be an understatement. My wife usually never finishes her entree (she did), and it was the absolute best chicken I have ever eaten (anywhere). The only thing that would have made it any better would have been a nice piece of crusty bread to lap up the sauce, as licking the plate would have probably been in bad taste! Outstanding experience from start to finish.	1
TITLE: A Wonderful Dining Experience | TEXT: Enjoyed a. kitchen a number of years ago, and I recall having an excellent meal. Dined there again this evening, and was blown away by the attentive service, warm atmosphere and amazing cuisine.  Paul & Jess at the bar were excellent hosts, offering dining recommendations, taste pairings, checking in, and generally ensuring all their patrons were well-served.  The dishes were original and delicious, thoroughly satisfying. One of the best meals I’ve experienced in the past decade.  Highly recommend!	1
TITLE: Great for crab and other seafood! | TEXT: This is a casual Vietnamese BYOB restaurant that serves very good standards like pot stickers, excellent chicken wings with different preparations, and some combination seafood/corn/sausage/potatoes dishes steamed in a bag and suitable for 2-4 people.  Of course there are also noodle bowls with various choices of meats.	0
TITLE: Best Bolognese Pasta Dish | TEXT: Best bolognese dish I have ever had. My young son and I were able to get a table on a Sunday night without reservations. Even though I visited the Italian North End several times Grotto on Beacon Hill was the best restaurant of the trip. It is small and quaint.	0
TITLE: Cheap and skimpy | TEXT: Do not waste your time coming here. They tend to be very skimpy when it comes to your food. I paid for two beef, cheese & rice burritos which the cook put about 5 pieces of rice in each burrito! I called to speak with the manager and he said it was a mistake (yeah right) and that he wouldn't charge me for rice on my next order! He should've been offering two new burritos, if that's the best you can do, I will not be back! Also, they limit you on the salsa to go, you only get one per burrito and it's only a teaspoon.  Terrible and cheap! Try other places that believe in giving you your money's worth.	1
TITLE: Simply amazing and awesome! | TEXT: We were very excited to eat at Carbone in Miami after being regulars of the New York City location. The ambience is very familiar also very different and unique. It was an absolutely incredible meal and everything was done with perfection. We sat outside on the patio and had a nice evening, Miami breeze and our waitress was attentive and helpful on while not overselling each other high restaurants in Miami certainly do.	0
TITLE: We watched a short film at the museum prior to the tour | TEXT: Our guide was Theodore, he did an excellent job sharing his knowledge of Warren Harding and Florence- marriage, campaign and presidency. The tour started on the porch where his Porch Campaign took place. The house furnishings are over 90% original. NO Pictures allowed which is sad for my personal journey ablum. The museum has nice exhibits with a couple audios. Enjoyed watching the pictures taken on the Voyage of Understanding tour to the western states and Alaska. Purchase tickets on-line because we were shocked how the first 3 tours were fully booked. We changed our itinerary to make a late afternoon tour. Large parking lot. Restrooms on site.	1
TITLE: [no title] | TEXT: Had  a great breakfast of eggs and a blueberry pancake. Everything was cooked to perfection. The bacon was crisp as ordered.

I don't need a service dog to comfort my sorry ...	1
"TITLE: Superb heritage centre river cruise with excellent commentary | TEXT: I spent a most enjoyable 5 hours on the Thames, on this year's annual Maidenhead Heritage Centre cruise, and what a treat!  Apart from a little light rain, we enjoyed good weather and views between Maidenhead and Marlow.  But what really made it stand out was Richard Poad's informative, interesting and amusing commentary.  Do you know how many bathtubs it takes to fill Boulters Lock.  I though my answer ""a lot"" was pretty good, but not good enough.  I'm afraid you'll have to wait until September 2026 for the next chance."	0
TITLE: Commanders Okay, but Antoine’s was Astounding | TEXT: Commanders Palace was good, but it doesn’t compare with the variety and tastefully compared menu at Antoine’s.  It was our first time at both restaurants this trip, and we much preferred Antoine’s, no comparison.  Antoine’s was more pricey, but you get what you pay for.	0
TITLE: Peleau | TEXT: My first time eating here, the food was ok .  To much oil in the dish made it greasy.    they give a generous portion you can share with at least three people.                          The owner very nice and polite and welcoming.	1

TITLE: Absolutely Wonderful | TEXT: My fiancee, Marie and I eat there all the time. The food is outstanding, the service is excellent and the homemade flour tortillas are just like abuelita (grandma) used to make. We love this place.	0
TITLE: No reason to go anywhere else | TEXT: If this was the only restaurant in Philly, I would be all set. No reason to go anywhere else. a.kitchen has been consistently exceptional for years. Incredibly good food. Always interesting and very good wine. And the staff and servers here are great; welcoming and always accommodating.	0
TITLE: Always great | TEXT: My seventh time at Suze and they never disappoint.  The meal was spectacular and the service same.  Wine list is very strong and, as they used to be BYOB, they do not gouge you on the wine up charge so buying a bottle is reasonable.   My go to place for a special meal occasion as I can count on them to deliver!	0
TITLE: Fun, relaxing, and pleasant. This is a great place to dine with your wife, family, or friends.

I ordered a cocktail called the South Philly, and it was really refreshing. we also ordered their pull apart rolls with softened butter it was warm and soft. And for the main course, we ordered a couple of their seafood dishes	1

TITLE: Terrific All Around Experience! | TEXT: Birthday celebration with myself and my best friend for her upcoming 60th!   Made the reservation online, you were asked if it was for a special occasion, and I said yes for a birthday, and there was a place for comments and I requested a table instead of a booth and when we got there, they knew exactly what we were looking for and seated us accordingly. There was also a small happy birthday sign on the table with some happy birthday confetti around the candle on in the center of the table.   The staff from the hostess to the weight staff, were all outgoing and customer oriented.    We got the Caesar salad, shared a shrimp cocktail, shared lobster mac & cheese. One of us got the ribeye, and one of us got the fillet.    Everything we had was exceptional.   The flavors were spot on, and the portions were generous. The shrimp cocktail came with four jumbo shrimp, which were truly jumbo.   After the salad and the shrimp, we managed to each eat a little bit of the mac & cheese and some of our steaks. We took the rest home for leftovers.   We also ordered a piece of carrot cake to go. The carrot cake was OK and the portion was ridiculously large. The carrot cake is the only not great part of the experience, but certainly not a showstopper.    I would certainly go again.	1
TITLE: What's not to like?! | TEXT: We had lunch here - very nice. It's located in the heart of the French Quarter - stairs to climb if you want to view the area from above (and who doesn't? LOL) but also seating available on ground level if stairs are too difficult for you. Nice menu selection. Our server was very friendly. I had a shrimp 'po boy sandwich - it was good. My husband scored - he ordered the red beans and rice - dang - it was beyond delicious! Really enjoyed it. The bar drinks were good. Our total for the po boy, red beans and rice - two hurricane drinks was $76. A bit pricey - but you're in the center of the action and have a great view. Glad we went!	0
TITLE: Review of Revue | TEXT: Revue captures the imagination and breaks the boundaries of what you would expect from a traditional restaurant experience. With multiple themed areas scattered throughout you are sure to have a different “view” each time you visit. Our family of four was seated on “Garrisons” family porch overlooking the “courtyard” bar as dusk beamed through the surrounding “tree” foliage. Needless to say the theming of the entire space was on the level of a Broadway stage. The food here is absolutely delicious! Every dish we tried was bursting with flavor and cooked to perfection. The portions were appropriate and everyone left satisfied. I highly recommend the Pea Risotto and Prosciutto Pizza. The sourdough pizza base made my partner question their loyalty to our local pizza shop! The night was made complete with our amazing server Tugce. She was friendly, attentive, and went above and beyond to ensure a memorable dining experience. She was incredibly knowledgeable about the menu and offered excellent recommendations as we navigated the mouthwatering menu. She was attentive without being intrusive and made us feel like family. Truly outstanding service from start to finish. Don’t walk, RUN to this amazing establishment inside The Fairmont Austin.	1
TITLE: Deserves 6 Stars! | TEXT: Our friends raved about this place, so we had to go. And we’ll go back every time we’re in Portland.  My husband’s burger practically melted in his mouth, and he thought the catsup (is there bbq sauce mixed in?) was crazy good on his fries. The breakfast brisket I ordered was nothing like expected. Layers of sautéed kale and other veggies, tender meat, and crispy waffle topped with a perfectly fried egg. The fingerling potatoes were piping hot, sooo fresh and flavorful. My husband, a home brewer, thought the beer selection was diverse enough for hoppy lovers and brown ale fans. We were impressed with the local pilsner and ale we had.	1
TITLE: Very talented chef | TEXT: The dishes were all excellent and full of flavor while having a great visual element as well. The leek soup had a wonderful unctuousness. The duck breast was perfectly warm,  soft, and the fat rendered; wholly satisfying with a light glaze. The fish was a flaky Branzino with a skin just crusty to add to the earthy flavors of the foraged mushrooms. The sake selection was outstanding. We really enjoyed the dining experience. There were multiple families with active small children on a Saturday night though.	1
TITLE: Riff of Miami not nice | TEXT: I hope you read my review before you eat and not after as i did. Food average Told Happy hour ..but 2 beers still cost € $25 for 2 beers. Service 20% and we were shouted at tat we had to pay it. Not a good example of how to treat customers in your town AVOID AVOID AVOID. This has left a very bad impression of your town and your restaurant. Rip off	1
TITLE: Hmm so so | TEXT: Tamales had taken on a taste from the freezer or something, very odd not so good .  Beef meat is unseasoned just beef. Menu is misleading said it came with beans and rice too and they brought it out with a salad no dressing beans were right out of a can . Said meal was covered in cheese and it was white caso that should have been in the description on the menu. Guacamole was just avacados tomato and onion not flavored at all . Salsa and chips were great . Service was good but they failed to realize we hadn't ate our food but kept asking if we wanted boxes.	1
TITLE: DELICIOUS | TEXT: Food is great, service is great, our favorite date night place. The only catch is there’s no call ahead, no reservations, and no text to your phone when the table is ready so be patient (and get there early).	1
TITLE: Disappointed | TEXT: The afternoon staff was very pleasant, room was clean. Went for breakfast 10 min before they shut down and housekeeper had the only face and attitude, giving us the side eye. Rushing my partner and I so she can turn everything off. To me that was very disrespectful as we paid almost $275 the night to stay there for a concert at Mohegan Casino.	1
"TITLE: Good Food, Good Vibe | TEXT: We stopped by Frog and the Bull this evening for a quick bite after an event close by...  totally picked the place off of Yelp and my confidence in my fellow Yelpers to be on point.  We were not disappointed!  Frog and the Bull is a modest sized place in a strip mall, nice vibe, folks having a good time at the bar.  Destiny was our waitress, she did a great job, attentive but not intrusive.  Thanks Destiny!  We started the meal with the brussels sprouts on the recommendation of Destiny.  What a winner that dish is!  Sprouts, apples, Manchego cheese, sherry vinegarette reduction and some awesome bacon bits... heaven on a plate!   For entrees, we opted for the pepper-crusted filet, medium rare, and the fish and chips.  Both plates were good.  The filet was cooked perfectly, spot on temperature, and the pepper-crust was a bit overpowering.  Not bad, interesting.  We're more purists when it comes to meat, so the filet itself would likely have been even more delicious.  The sides of asparagus and pasta were okay, a Basque-style potato on the side would have outshined the pasta.    The fish and chips were good.  The fish was fresh, nice batter, served piping hot as it should be.  The fish portion was modest, especially given the price tag.  At that price point ($25), the fish serving should have been twice the size.  The initial serving of ""chips"" were room temperature at best, but that was quickly remedied by Destiny when brought to her attention.  The truffle fries are darn good when hot!  All in all, a good meal.  A 4-star experience.  The above observations are intended to suggest options for improvements, not criticize.  The ""Frog"" portion of the restaurant's name is an homage by the owner (a former Navy Seal) to his fallen Navy brethren.  (Note the Navy Seal Trident above the entrance to the kitchen).  Thank you for your service!  We will be back, lots of other stuff to try on the menu.  Recommend Frog and the Bull, nice vibe, good food."	1
"TITLE: We love this place!! We travel miles to get to OUR FAVORITE ITALIAN RESTAURANT. | TEXT: Bestie came and we introduced them to our favorite Italian place. We also go every year for his birthday.  We tried: The goat cheese ball appetizer- Excellent sauce with the bread to dip with.🤌 The food truck favorite- good flavor ❤️ pesto. The limoncello ""smooth & creamy""🤤. The orange cake tastes like a grandma made it with love & the pecans were lighty toasted/ crunchy & the carmel was smooth & sweet like honey OMG! The owner suggested the chocolate mousse. WOW!! 🙃 I instantly turned into the Kool-aid man ""OH YEAH"" it was so good. We all give it 5 stars.🤩😍"	1
TITLE: Strong Across the Board | TEXT: Based on the reviews, I came in with low expectations yet the overall space is very impressive with very high-end, unique decor. The menu is unique and comprehensive. You can eat family style or individual servings. Our server was really good. We were attended to across the board by three layers of staff, and to top it all off our table of seven all thought the food was exceptional. The calamari were some of the best we’ve ever had. The bread service was incredibly impressive. The lobster risotto was delicious and the desserts were all top-notch.	1
TITLE: No soap in the toilets!!! | TEXT: An amazing collection of memorabilia and superb drinks, what a shame it is let down by basic hygiene standards!! A notice is displayed in the toilets instructing staff to wash their hands but how can employees or customers wash their hands effectively when there is no soap in the ladies toilets other than the disabled toilet!! Shocking!!	1

TITLE: Excellent Tapas Spot | TEXT: Was excited to see this tapas place near our hotel, especially as my colleagues had never tried tapas before. The standards (patatas bravas, pan con tomate, croquettes) were all great. The pork belly was so good we ordered it twice. Would come back again for sure.	0
TITLE: Harding Presidential Sites | TEXT: We had a great visit to the Warren G Harding Presidential Library and Memorial. The Library (aka Museum) is quite small compared to other presidential libraries, but does a good job telling the story of Harding's short presidency. Tours of his home are only offered on the hour, so we had to miss that, but did take photos from the outside. We also visited the Harding Memorial in the cemetery, which was quite impressive. If you're passing by Marion, Ohio, take a break from your drive and stop by to see the presidential sites.	0
TITLE: Neat find!  Good food. | TEXT: This was a neat find.  There is indoor and outdoor seating.  We sat outside & the server pulled up a heater for us when it started to get a little chilly.   We ordered Cordon Bleu, & Schnitzel.  The Cordon Bleu was delicious!  The side I ordered was Spatzle & it was a little dry.   There are a ton of combinations that you can customize your entrée with.   We also ordered a pretzel for an appetizer, and a Bee Sting for dessert.  Both were good.	1

"TITLE: Beware of charges on your bill... | TEXT: First off, the food was amazing and the service fantastic which makes the rest such a shame.  1. If you make an 8:30 reservation DO NOT choose the 5 course option or chefs choice. You will not have time to fully enjoy the experience.  We weren't even at desert when the place was empty and everyone was cleaning up around us and the bartender left. The music got louder and we were told that if we were uncomfortable we could wrap up the final courses to go. If at the end you still plan going. Keep your choices Ala carte and not so many. 2. We get the bill. Now like most trusting people who aren't expecting to get ripped off we would have just paid but because our server forgot to add our bottle of wine (no problem, these things happen) I decided to look at the check to make sure the rest was right. First thing I see is the beverage tax. In Philly the beverage tax is applied to sweet drinks and energy drinks NOT alcoholic drinks. We did not have what the tax is intended for. We were also charged an $8 credit card fee. With this one-how did they know I'd use a charge card? What if I paid with cash. That aside I did use a DEBIT card. A debit card is the same as cash and cannot be charged a fee. We even googled these things when speaking to the manager to say hey, we're not making this up! When you say to a manager ""you're taxing us twice for the bottle of wine?"" and he says ""YES"", there's a problem.  He even removed the beverage tax. (The manager was great and unless the owner would prefer he lied and look stupid,  he did his job) at this point I wasn't going to argue the credit card charge, though he was aware that it was wrong, these people don't make the big money and wanted to go home. This is a Townsend Wentz restaurant. We have eaten at Townsend as well as Amano. We couldn't recall if these charges were applied there in the underhanded way they were applied here but again, we're people who trust and don't expect to get ripped off. I'm thinking the owners are putting their bets on that. Honestly, of the many, many restaurants we have dined at in Philly, this was a first. My son-in-law is a chef and restaurant owner. He'd never risk his reputation by putting a beverage tax on alcohol served or charge the customer $8 for the use of a debit card (let alone put it on the bill before knowing how the customer is paying).  Yes, the food and service was fantastic, so if you're ok with $25 in taxes-the majority of which should NOT be charged-and the knowledge you're being taken advantage of...Townsend Wentz will give you that."	1
TITLE: Venetian Italian Small Plates | TEXT: We were a party of 8 and did the special tasting menu for $65 pp. I don’t eat beef or duck so a few of the dishes were not for me but the group overall enjoyed most of the plates. Many items were off menu, but not all. We started with beet arancini (yum!), then a liver mousse ball, meatballs (the most traditional Italian of the dishes), followed by rainbow carrots over ricotta with sugared ginger, bacalao on toast, tuna crudo (our least favorite), clams with grilled bread, two pasta dishes and a panacotta, fig, peach tuile dessert! Yes, that’s more than 8 but we got an extra dish or two ! The service was very nice and the restaurant is great looking. Very special meal	0
TITLE: Learning at the Warren G. Harding Presidential Sites | TEXT: Great trip. We arrived at approximately 9:30 am and made our way towards the entrance of the museum. After paying the admission fee, we received a quick overview of the site and went on our way. We opted to view some of the outdoor exhibits first, which included the guard house and press house. The press house contained multiple informational plaques about President Hardings wife and her contributions to society. After viewing the press house, we made our way to the front porch of the house, where we waited for the 10 am guided hour tour to begin. There were guided tours of the presidents former house being held every hour throughout the day. The guided tour of the house was very informational, and the tour guide took us from room to room, while pointing out interesting features and artifacts out for display. The tour guide told us several personal stories related to the Hardings time at the house. The guided tour lasted roughly 1 hour.  After viewing the house, we went back inside to view the main exhibits. We opted to watch a short documentary about President Hardings life and some of the trials and tribulations he faced during his time as President. There were multiple informational plaques out for display, many of them quite text heavy, that went into detail about Hardings upbringing and roots as the owner of a newspaper company in Marion. The plaques also talked about election day, and several of the policy’s Harding implemented while in office. The last section of the museum dealt with his death and some controversial issues that surrounded his presidency. There were multiple artifacts out for display in the museum, along with short video clips that related to President Harding's time in office.  Tip: I recommend spending 3 hours here if you truly want to see everything.	1
TITLE: Good Brunch | TEXT: We came here for brunch on a Sunday.  We had the stuffed french toast, gyro omelete, crepes, corned beef hash skillet and sophia's skillet and  coffee.  4 people  and the bill with tip was $91.  Not a cheap place for breakfast/brunch, but the serving size was big and the quality was pretty good.	1
TITLE: Trying too hard to be something… | TEXT: The ingredient list on the “shared” plates was so overly complicated that the flavors hit wrong on the palate. Whoever cooked the steak had to have worked in a steakhouse, it was perfectly cooked, perfectly sauced and came out hot. The “best selling” bread with pimento cheese was deconstructed with pimento in one pile and cheese in another. Guys really? We ordered the crudo which was sauced well but the fish was bland. The noodle dish which was so embarrassingly small, luke warm and brown. This your best offering for a vegetarian dish at $14? We sent it back. We eat all over the world, the constant changing of the cutlery and dishes seemed like a cup game to dazzle.	1
TITLE: Service bad / food good. | TEXT: Got a reservation within minutes of arrival ( it was 11:55am we wanted and were able to secure a noon reservation without issue).   We sat at the bar, we were told 3 times we’d get water ( never arrived ).  Had it not been for a manager who I flagged down, I’m certain I’d still be waiting to place an order.    The spicy guacamole was top notch - do order this.    The steak and eggs was good.   The house salad was very good - do order this.   Spicy Bloody Mary is very spice - do order this.	1
TITLE: Very tasty and Great service! | TEXT: Came across the sign online and followed for a while, laughed a lot. While visiting Austin said how about El Aroyo and was disappointed to see the trip advisor rating of 3.5– especially after tasting the Cancun Avocado Plate and the Mezcalita. Great service from Laura! Unpretentious place with good food and clever wit. I’m here to lift that rating and tell you go have fun and eat good there!	0

TITLE: Commander’s Corner | TEXT: My husband and I were visiting New Orleans from Virginia. I took my husband to lunch for his birthday on November 12th. Our reservations were for 11:30 we arrived around 11:15 and we were first to arrive. So at 11:30 we were taken to our seats.  We were seated at a table with balloons as there were other tables that had balloons.  Service was impeccable and the food was outstanding but as my husband and I looked around the room we both noticed that as two Afro Americans we were seated or placed in the back in the corner while the rest of the room began to fill up with Caucasians, some regulars and some visiting tourists .  This was our second time in New Orleans and second time at Commander’s Palace.  This experience made us very uncomfortable and showed us that somethings just won’t change.	1
TITLE: Sad night…. | TEXT: Stopped in because of the reviews. The appetizer was great. But both my wife and I had ordered the Fish & Chips. The fish was way over done. So over done I was surprised they even served it. My piece was actually burnt on the end.   And the fries were dark and chewy as if they had been re-heated many times. Very sad indeed when compared to the reviews. On a positive note, we were not charged for either dinner.	1
TITLE: It's Educational! | TEXT: Maidenhead Heritage Centre is a small building on the edge of the town centre. It is close to the library and with the help of google was easy to find.  There is a small admission charge but well worth it. There is history of the area from ancient times and also more recently including a diorama of the railway in the area. There is also a bit of history about women politicians in the area. I did not realise that Theresa May was not the first lady politician in the area of note.  The most interesting thing to see in the centre is the ATA on the first floor. Colin shared a great deal about the men and women who served in this organisation. There is alot of information on display and it is impressive that this collection of exhibits is available to educate people like me.  HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!	1
TITLE: So so experience | TEXT: Flavors are nice. Rations sizes  are tiny.  Octopus overcook and cold  Nice atmosphere in a snail place  You shall book your visit	1
TITLE: Consistent excellence | TEXT: This was our third visit to this always busy restaurant. The food was again excellent. Our wait person was excellent and provided valuable advice. Every dish was special and will return again soon!	0
TITLE: Reservation request not honored | TEXT: Why make a reservation when they don't honor your request. My husband's 50th birthday dinner was ruined.  After seeing the reviews, I am so glad I didn't waste my money on this place.	0
TITLE: A Hidden Gem in NW Portland | TEXT: On Saturday night, we were invited to dinner by a friend at Cassidy's Restaurant. What a nice surprise! After 26 years spending lots of living nearby in the Pearl, we discovered this place that has been there since 1979. The food was excellent, the dining room was peaceful, and the wood paneling and flooring provided a great NW atmosphere. The bar is as attractive as it looks on their website. The menu was very good and the cost was very reasonable. Try it out.	0
TITLE: Nice apt, friendly staff, good value!! | TEXT: The prior reviews are quite old, so we couldn't count on TripAdvisor reviews for Dunas Park Beach Club.   The reception staff (including Tania) were absolutely delightful and very helpful. The apt itself was a one bedroom on the ground floor. It was quite spacious for the two of us and had a patio/sitting area out back looking out on the garden.  The WiFi signal was good, the TV only had one English Channel (news). Never-ending hot water and great water pressure in the shower. The kitchen was nicely stocked - even w sponge and dish soap!   All 3 floors of the apt can use the rooftop terrace, which allows you to see the sunset - or just walk to the cliffs/beach trail.   We didn't use the nice pool (free) or other (paid) amenities like mini-golf, tennis, etc.   We really enjoyed the location and the apt!	1
TITLE: Overpriced | TEXT: Small portions, not that great and high priced.    Kind of fancy for a strip mall, and just not what I expected.	0
TITLE: Coconut Grove favorite | TEXT: War a spectacular restaurant.  The ambiance is fun and classy, the service impeccable, the prix fee menu ample and such a value and the food eland drinks delicious.  Such a treat.	0
TITLE: Best in Jacksonville | TEXT: First time. Excellent food. Best Italian in Jacksonville. Long line to get it. Had a approximately a two hour wait to get in but food was well worth it. Small restaurant with only about 12 tables which is why the wait. Staff very friendly and great knowledge of the menu. Great service. Definitely will be back. Did ask but no reservations, first come, first served.	1
"TITLE: Never disappoints | TEXT: They always make us feel special.  We only dine here a couple times a year because it's a bit far from home, but it's worth the drive.  Our server this time was ""Bow"", and he is delightful - so knowledgeable and eloquent with his descriptions of the menu offerings, as well as making time to chat a little.  We love this place!"	1
TITLE: Sooo deliciously and yet disappointing! | TEXT: I so looked forward to coming to this location, Ignored as much as possible the crazy noise that I as well as my friends had to yell at our server who could not hear our order... Loved the food but the service was truly unacceptable ! There was NO ONE who looked responsible enough to get their attention, to acknowledge our needs. At the end, our server was eating dinner and we could not get her or any one's attention ( the place was at that point pretty quiet). our friend had to walk up to her to ask for a refill...  Hate giving a small tip ( Which we did not...hope the chef got some acknowledgment) when the people responsible to do the hiring do not take ownership of this so vulnerable business!	1
TITLE: Never had a bad meal or experience here | TEXT: I've probably eaten here a dozen times and it's always been a pleasant experience.  The staff is always friendly and they act like they take pride in their work and product they put out.  I wouldn't really characterize the process as FAST FOOD.  More of a cook to order deal, but that's just fine with me because the wait is well worth it and I like my food hot and fully cooked (which it always has been at this place).  Eating at this Captain D's, I almost feel like I'm eating at home.  They have a home-like atmosphere.  Welcoming and like I belong when I'm eating here.  The restaurant is clean with tables bused and wiped.  The condiments are easily accessible.  When I have to travel back to Marianna in August, re-visiting this restaurant will be at the top of my TO-DO list.  We always love visiting this Captain D's :-))  Their Tarter Sauce is the absolute best on the planet and my spouse likes their malt vinegar.	1
"TITLE: Skip the Dinner and Just have Dessert and Coffee | TEXT: Sister and I went for dinner.  She ordered veal and I ordered the scallop and pasta special.  Her veal and potatoes were very good but the ""vegetable medley"" was a pile of mushy vegs. The best thing that could be said about my dish were the two blistered cherry tomatoes were tasty.  The bead size scallops were rubbery, the small amt of sauce was incredibly bland, and the dish was dry. The side garden salads were very nice size, fresh and good.  The salted caramel cheesecake was amazing and strangely enough, the decaf coffee  was truly terrific.  However, a $97 meal (we ordered no alcohol) with mushy vegetables and a non-edible entree was a big disappointment.  The reason I did not send back my entree was that it took 45 minutes for our meal to arrive.  There were 3 servers and 9 tables, so that was not the issue."	1
TITLE: Flavor party in every bite | TEXT: One of the best restaurants ever! If you enjoy flavor and creativity and great service, this place hits all the marks! The chefs choice tasting menu was fantastic!	0
TITLE: poor afternoon tea for a restaurant with London in its name | TEXT: I didn't want to complain about this, because the staff members were all so great.  But our afternoon tea was overpriced and poorly prepared.  Nothing seemed to have been created in-house; the pastries were gummy and the chicken curry was unrecognizable.  The tea was made from a tea bag and only one was offered.  The view was stunning, of course, but it is difficult to have what feels like an elegant experience when the table top is so sticky.  Alas- very poor value and a big disappointment.	1
TITLE: Amazing craft cocktails | TEXT: I visited the Woolworth while on a business trip with my boss. We sat outside on the rooftop patio and enjoyed a nice view of the city. The ambience was nicely appreciated after a long day of work. We ordered a few small plates and some craft cocktails. Everything was delicious, and our service was top-notch and I would definitely go back if I were in the area again.	0
"TITLE: We wouldn't recommend it. | TEXT: Casual is right...it's in a run-down plaza, very basic interior, and you have to order from the counter, although they do bring it to your table.  The ""hostess"" behind the counter was less than warm and cheerful, and that combined with the lack of ambiance almost made us leave.  However, they had fried oysters on the menu which I'd been craving so we stayed. I had the oysters and absolutely tasteless coleslaw.  The oysters themselves were plump and juicy, but the breading was too heavy and flavorless.  My husband had grilled shrimp wrapped in bacon and fries.  Bacon was basically raw and shrimp, which plump, were tasteless.   Prices were higher than they should be in a place like this.  If it was going for a seaside hut vibe, they definitely missed it.  We would not go back."	1
TITLE: WELL WORTH A VISIT! PRO TIP: THE RESTAURANT IS FANTASTIC! | TEXT: This is a great way to spend 1 to 3 hours looking at some really unique art and learning about their creators. When we were there they had 100+ wildlife “action” photos on loan from the London museum of Natural History and it was fantastic. As an added bonus, the on-site restaurant had really good high-end food and live music at lunch time.	0
TITLE: Decent Mexican retaurant caters to locals | TEXT: Nice local restaurant.  I was from out of town and it seemed like I didn't get as much attention as those who were local.  The food was pretty good and the overall experience was much better than the large chain Mexican restaurant a few blocks away.  Will visit again if in town.	0
TITLE: Museum and House Tour Make this a fun Visit | TEXT: A visit to this presidential library comprises three potential activities.  First, there is an hour long tour of his house.  Second, the main building includes a small exhibition of his time as President.  Lastly, a mile from the library is his memorial.  We spent just under two hours here.	0
TITLE: Wonderful lunch treat | TEXT: We had not visited the Gazebo in years, so while visiting Marianna, we stopped by .Our server was Kim, and she took great care of us. The food was delicious.	0

TITLE: Best roasted potatos ever! | TEXT: Beautiful place. Went for brunch. Food was great although my eggs could have been warmer. Service was good and friendly but as the place filled up—our reservation was at opening time—our waitress disappeared. However, really enjoyed it and would visit again.	1
TITLE: Waiter | TEXT: Jake was a fantastic waiter.  We usually look forward to George.  In this case Jake was a pleasant replacement.  Food always excellent.  We have been coming here since Fare opened.  A fantastic neighborhood restaurant.  A must “give it a try”.	0
TITLE: Worth the Splurge | TEXT: Marianna has almost no truly “good” choices for eating out. The Salt Block is a gift to this whole area of cheap eats and fried foods. The steaks are pricey but AMAZING-the restaurant is modest but clean. I am grateful for this restaurant and what they provide.	1
TITLE: More cities should have a Reading Terminal with its excellent regional food choices and great prices | TEXT: I love coming to the Reading Terminal Market with the great selection of food stalls and the sights and smells as you walk around. I love their selections and the interaction between the locals and tourists when people are ordering.   Some of my favorite places to eat in Philly are here with Dutch Eating Place, Beilers Bakery and Bassetts Ice Cream. When Carmine’s was open, that used to be my favorite place for Cheesesteaks. After a meal, I like to walk around and look at the food displays. Everyone merchandises their food so nicely.  Don’t miss a visit here when you are visiting Philly.	0
TITLE: Splendid Saison | TEXT: What a splendid meal at Saison. An innovative and tasty set menu with many standout dishes and presentation - lobster tartare, uni, white truffle pasta, duck etc. I would probably skip the wagyu supplement next time since i’m not a fan of wagyu generally   Service top notch and friendly as well  The kitchen tour was a plus  9.5/10	0
TITLE: Best dinner I ever had !! | TEXT: I had the best dinner I ever had. The filet mignon was tender, cooked to perfection, and seasoned perfectly. The Greek salad dressing was amazing. The lemon ricotta cake awesome. Can't rave enough.	1
TITLE: We weren’t expecting much judging from the outside | TEXT: But Franco the owner was sooo amazing. Ferrying us around when we needed help. He looks like an old grizzly Italian. But he smiles and is so friendly. There is a picture on the wall of his dad in 1940 working behind the bar. Franco’s son works there too. They all look alike - and unfortunately smoke! The food is good. Fresh and interesting. Our room was large and light. Loads of hot water. Nothing posh. But comfortable. And clean. Italy at its best.	1
TITLE: A clean room to stay in | TEXT: I always trust Wyndham and for good reasons. The hotel was very well kept. Very clean room. The front dest staff were very sweet and helpful and they were very attentive during breakfast. Definitely recommend it.	0
TITLE: Prime Table is the best. | TEXT: First time visit. Ambiance was very nice. Shauna was our server and she greeted us with a smile. She was knowledgeable, and kept our drink glasses were always filled. She bagged our leftovers individually, labeled and dated them. The food was incredible. We had their prime rib and it was impressed.	1
TITLE: A welcome surprise | TEXT: When we got to San Quirico and saw the town, the main square, and the outside of the hotel, we were prepared to be disappointed. It's a small town, there's a gas station in the center of the piazza, and if you're looking for the hotel - well, the sign mostly indicates the restaurant: Ristorante La Vecchia Fonte. In fact, you have to enter the restaurant, walk through to the back, and say you have a reservation in the hotel. The friendly and helpful (though somewhat English-challenged) staff take you upstairs and show you your room - the rooms are bright, clean, and usable, with views overlooking the piazza or the town. It's a 15 minute (or so) level walk to the historic abandoned town of Vertozza nearby; otherwise, there's not much to do in San Quirico. We had dinner in the hotel's restaurant (Very good!) and breakfast (included) in the back of the restaurant. The promised WiFi didn't seem to connect in our room - but this is often the case in Italian hotels in our experience.	1
TITLE: Relax and enjoy the Palm | TEXT: I absolutely love this restaurant! Every time I’m in Boston I make my pilgrimage to the Palm. The food is amazing and the staff is At Olympic Gold Medal level. I could eat there and know I’m in for a joyous occasion!	0
TITLE: Regular | TEXT: Very nice property to take pics lol Went for my friends birthday . We had to wait a couple minutes before being seated as it was full even though we had reservations.. Food was ok nothing over the top At the end of the night we had some good pics	0
TITLE: Eat better for half the price in little Italy | TEXT: On the plus side, the roof top location is spectacular and the staff are very courteous and attentive but then there’s the food. I can honestly say I have never paid so much to be so underwhelmed. The food though well presented lacked the simple subtle flavours of authentic Italian food. The essence of Italian cooking is to make a few simple ingredients sing, the overall impression of our meal at the Contessa was bland, under-seasoned and definitely not singing. If the garlic and rosemary potatoes don’t taste of garlic or rosemary, there’s something wrong. We ate for half the price, with twice the flavour in little Italy	1
TITLE: Note worth the stop anymore. | TEXT: This place has gone down hill since new ownership took over.  Chicken had been on the steam table until it dried out.  Peach cobbler sat empty the entire time we were there. Desserts by the salad bar we not as good as the old days. So sad.   We won't be back.	1
TITLE: Great food and service | TEXT: We did the food cart scene in Portland. Wanted to try something different so read the reviews on this restaurant and they were all excellent reviews. Went there and had a great dinner. We had two salmon dishes, and they were excellent our waitress was very attentive .	0
TITLE: The Cellar Boys on Tuesday nights are amazing; Green Mill service is lacking | TEXT: This is said to be the oldest club in Chicago! We were here on a Tuesday night to see the Cellar Boys, and it was wonderful! We were disappointed to have to share a table, especially given that it was the night of our 30th anniversary and we are both introverts, but I do get it - it is a small venue. I cannot say enough good things about the Cellar Boys - wow, they were awesome! Service at the club was not great. I went up to the bar to ask for water as I was parched, and two people were behind the bar watching the band. I am easy to miss being only five feet tall, so I waved to the lady and she headed my way and looked really angry. Alas, sorry but I really needed water badly, and my server had not been around in ages! I left a tip on the bar and hoped for better days for her. Regardless of the service, I highly recommend stopping in to see the Cellar Boys!	1
TITLE: Outstanding food 15% grat with no service | TEXT: I would love to come back because food was absolutely delicious and flavorful, I don’t agree on a 15% grat when I server only took our order never returned to table at all. Even had to go to bar to get to pay tab so we could leave. Hope service becomes better.	1
TITLE: Great food - very tasty! | TEXT: Fantastic food - we had mushroom bruschetta and steamed buns and pork belly to start. They were so tasty and the two between three of us was perfect.  Then for mains we had the raviolini, halibut and a duck special. All of us were very happy!  The chunky monkey ice cream was also very tasty.  We tried this restaurant because if the great reviews and we weren’t disappointed. If we are back in Portland we would definitely return.	0
TITLE: Excellent! | TEXT: The food is very, very good and the atmosphere and service excellent. I came back after several years- and found the inventiveness and quality very good still.	0
TITLE: Beyond Great Experience Wilder Philadelphia! | TEXT: 2/26/25 Year End Celebration work lunch in semi-private space upstairs. Exceeded our expectations on all fronts! Food, staff, service, beautiful space. Worked closely with Brett who owns Wilder with his partner Nicole. I let Brett know that is was wonderful and we cannot wait to return for another work event and to bring family and friends.  Thanks for everything Brett!	0
TITLE: Most amazing italian restaurant ever | TEXT: The pear pasta is so amazing it’s compelling me to write a good review.  This place never disappoints. The staff is very friendly and the food is absolutely delicious.  Once you come here you’ll never go to any other italian spot.  This is THE BEST in Jax. 100%  Get the Pear Fiocchi.  Ur welcome	0
TITLE: Do not go here | TEXT: They are so unfriendly and so stuck on themselves. We could not get out of our RV spot because the way they did the roads and they’re blaming us because we drove over the grass. We have a 45 foot coach and that’s the spot they put us in where we could not get out. The woman came out yelling at us screaming so unprofessional. There’s a kind way to handle things and there is a bad way to handle things and this woman handle things extremely poorly. They have all these rules here and I am so unhappy with this park I would keep going. There’s other nice parks in the Durango area.	1
TITLE: Kings Pub closed | TEXT: Kings Pub is no longer there, closed to make way for hotel and flats, very disappointing. Visited numerous times over the years, so sad to see it has gone.	0
TITLE: Frog bull | TEXT: Try and try as I  may--this place just has horrible customer service. We have attempted them 3 times! Just not warm and welcoming at all, which is sad and disappointing because they are within walking distance for us.	0
TITLE: MUST TRY IN THE ARTS DISTRICT | TEXT: Had anniversary cocktails and apps here. SUCH amazing food and drinks. Service was EXEPTIONAL. I recommend everyone to go	0
TITLE: Don’t miss it!   Wonderful experience. | TEXT: Amazing service from Austin!  Great wine recommendation.  The food was outstanding.  I loved the pasta course.  Wish I could have that every day!  Not our first or last visit to this wonderful restaurant.	0
TITLE: Affordable Turkish Meal | TEXT: There were 4 of us who dined in this restaurant. We were the only customers which could be because it was 2 days before Valentine’s Day. I could not fault the service. The food was well presented and cooked healthily. I enjoyed my chicken shish but would have preferred to have it marinated as I’ve experienced elsewhere. The price was reasonable including the wines on offer.	0
"TITLE: They're Trying | TEXT: Some interesting sounding appetizers enticed us to check this place out. Furikake fries: unusual Japanese spices served with two uncommon sauces, quoth the menu.  Blah.  Flavorless.  Sauces seemed mostly like ketchup with a bit of BBQ sauce and a mayo.  Unconsumable. BUT...the wood oven baked Khachapuri was quite tasty, although it could have used a much bigger dose of garlic and butter.  Again, unusual, with, of all things, a soft egg yolk proudly in the center.  Now, HOW this item appeared on what is a pretty standard fare menu is anyone's guess. The ""Ora"" king salmon was perfectly cooked and served on a plentiful bed of mixed vegetables.  Would be enhanced with some balsamic glaze, and that could be served in a cup on the side. The pineapple crisp dessert was another item that sounded great but whose execution left lots to be desired.   Topped with a rubberized piece of pineapple that could have served well as a drain closure.  Ice cream was OK, but they left the crisp off the crisp.  Oh, well... Pleasant, helpful, and attentive service personnel. Limited and not outrageously priced wine and beer offerings; easy free parking. Restroom could use some policing."	1
TITLE: Went down hill with non existant service and not so good food | TEXT: Went down hill big time.  Used to make the 90 mile run many times a year but this time really was the last ever.  waited 15 minutes to order drinks and that took another 15 with no coffee refills ever.  Food wasn't what it used to be and there was no service at all.  Then we had to wait 20 minutes to get our check and another 15 at the cash register.  Sad to see a once great place slide so bad	1
TITLE: Top quality | TEXT: Lovely food at  fair pricing served by professional staff. Would definitely recommend instead nearest similar outlet such as Mira.	0
TITLE: Great service and good food | TEXT: Found this gem for our lunch. It was hard to figure out what to order because prices were a bit high.  I ordered the Tuscany panini and my husband ordered a hamburger. We thoroughly enjoyed the sandwiches. Our French fries were hot and had great seasoning on them.  Service was incredible with very hardworking servers. The only negative for us was a radio that played in back. It was a tinny and loud and got irritating	1
TITLE: Expecting Better | TEXT: We arrived early for our reservation and we were seated quickly.  It was not very busy as it was a Wednesday night, but maybe a bit too busy for the limited waitstaff. The atmosphere was nice.  Not too noisy but a good sound and the kitchen is visible from the restaurant.  The food was a little disappointing.  We had several sides and the pork chop and they all seemed to be lacking flavor, they would good but we were expecting a bit more.  The service was good considering the waiter was handling quite a few tables.	0
"TITLE: Why have a reservation? | TEXT: I typically enjoy Haywire however, the past 2 times we have been awkwardly greeted by the hostess even with a reservation BOTH times.  The hostess seemed to be preoccupied and somewhat detached from greeting customers. The restaurant was maybe 30% capacity.  Slow Sunday around 1:30. The hostess tried to seat us at a tiny 2 top table on the patio. Our res was not for the patio. We asked if we could sit inside, and she hesitantly said ""yes"" and told us to have a seat and wait.....After waiting 10 minutes she took us past 6 open booths and 4 tables to sit us directly between two parties at another 2 top table.   We sat there for 7-8 minutes without being greeted by a server and decided to sit at the bar. When asked about all of the open booths and tables and we were told they were ""reserved and for 4 or more guests"".  We ordered two drinks at the bar and were handed menus.  The bartender was doing inventory and the service bartender stayed busy.   We had to flag down the bartender to order food after waiting 35 minutes.  The food was average.  My chicken was half breaded and the gravy was nonexistent which made eating it with the large biscuit dry and difficult. While sitting at the bar we noticed several of the booths were being sat with parties of 2. Upon leaving many of the tables and booths remained unoccupied.  The next time we Brunch in Dallas, this won't be high on our list.  The experience starts with the first face you see."	1
TITLE: Family of 6 celebrating a special birthday dinner | TEXT: We have been dining at this restaurant with our entire extended family many times over the years and the experience has generally been good. This visit was however most disappointing in terms of the food quality and service. It was a special birthday celebration and my steak dinner  entree came out barely warm so I asked for it to be redone or replaced with something else if that was easier. After a few minutes the very same plate reheated was served to me and passed off as fresh- I could immediately tell as id taken a bite of the potato piece earlier. The meat was obviously over cooked now that it had been reheated. I was so disappointed as it was not a fresh plate as one would expect from a fine dining restaurant.	1
TITLE: Toro | TEXT: Went for sushi which was good. Seated quickly and service was efficient. The place has a nice location across from the water with a parking lot.  We enjoyed it overall however it may be positive to tidy up and refresh the dining room.	1
TITLE: Good Flautas - March 2021 | TEXT: So a solid three stars for this little restaurant. Now there are only two Mexican restaurants in town. But coworkers have told me they weren't impressed whatsoever with the other place   I really felt like having some flautas. They had them on the menu but clarified that they were made corn tortillas. In my book, those are taquitos...and it was indicated on the menu. So I asked the waiter if they would make them with flour tortillas. He said no at first but then said he'd check with the cook. He returned and said no problem. While waiting I was served some salsa & chips...which were pretty average. I also had a Modelo Especial. My flautas (3) were very good and I recommend you request them this way if you order them. I even told my waiter he should suggest the option to his restaurant patrons.  Because of the pandemic, they created a drive up window, but don't know if you're required to call in your order ahead. Prices were average and the staff was nice. There's a small bar but I believe they only sell beer. There's a couple TV monitors inside. No complaints and nothing to rave about. No objections to eating here again.	1
TITLE: We liked it | TEXT: We got mahi in garlic sauce with yellow rice and plantains and it was delicious.  A busy restaurant but we weren’t rushed out.  Hope to go again.	0
TITLE: Great service but preferred food next door | TEXT: I loved my lasagna at Vespaio so decided to try their sister restaurant next door. At least I think it’s a sister restaurant - it sometimes is known as Enoteca Vespaio in articles I’ve read. Service at the bar was very good and the food was decent. I had the Caesar salad (should have declined the anchovies) and the rigatoni with arrabiata sauce and pork meatballs. The menus were very similar. I just preferred my meal and the cozy ambiance at Vespaio next door.	0
TITLE: Best restaurant in Austin, consistently | TEXT: We eat at Odd Duck a few times a year; they occasionally miss the mark with a dish or two, but generally over 2-3 visits a year for the past 5 years, they are consistent, with delicious food and friendly service, at prices that we feel good about, for the value. Cocktails are complex, layered, and super tasty.   We've tried a lot of other hyped up restaurants in Austin and been disappointed often. We'll come back to Odd Duck again and again.	0
TITLE: Disappointed This Time | TEXT: So I went to Warmdaddys for the first time last year in May. Food was good enough, but I especially liked the skillet mac and cheese and the cornbread. Went back on Tuesday expecting at least the same quality or better. Sadly, I was highly disappointed. The greens mixed with cabbage was watery, mushy, and flavorless. The yams were watery, the catfish was flavorless and didn’t seem like fresh fish. I’m thinking it was bagged. And the star of my first visit, the mac and cheese was dried out and flavorless! I will say the turkey wings were AMAZING!   Another thing worth mentioning is the 18% gratuity was charged without our knowledge. There was only two of us and the bill was $65, so adding gratuity wasn’t standard. When I asked the server about this, she informed us that it’s automatically added on certain nights.    After this experience with the food I probably won’t be back	1
TITLE: amazing | TEXT: wonderful delicious kosher food and wine decent covid policy good service and not pushy to buy a case of wine although many guests do I would go back again as soon as I can	1

"TITLE: Staff Attitude | TEXT: My first and last time dining at this restaurant. Our server was great but one staff that was working at the backyard was rude and nasty. She was annoyed when I was standing by the door of the restroom which I must say they have a very small place. She kicked me out by saying ""step outside!"" What an attitude treating their customers. We like exploring French restaurants in San Francisco but this will be out of our list and will not recommend. Disappointing!"	1
TITLE: Quiet pleasant two day stay. | TEXT: A lovely quiet family run hotel with very helpful staff. It's an older rustic building with a clean room comfortable bed with a mosquito net.   Nice garden a large water monitor came for a visit whilst I was having my breakfast the food both dinner and breakfast was good.  Great value for money.	1
TITLE: 3-star yes - but no glow | TEXT: Is Benu a 3-star restaurant?  For creativity, intelligence, dedication, flavours and sheer brilliance of the individual dishes, the answer is yes.  But I walked away feeling somewhat empty.  Reflecting on it, I think the dishes were individually brilliant but as a whole, it did not convey a sense of a journey or a story.  Modern Cali-Korean food is fine but where is it going?  And the service is not consistent and it was akin to a bistro service.  For the sort of cash Benu is asking for, the front of house needs to be improved significantly.  If this restaurant was in France, it would have lost 2 stars for the patchy service.	0
TITLE: Not Great but very inexpensive | TEXT: At first glance this hotel seemed to be well-located, as it is right at a busy 4-way intersection with a rotary and pedestrian bridge outside. That is, until you actually explore and find that there's nothing worth visiting around there. Yes, lots of stores and some restaurants, but really none of note. The hotel itself is pretty old, and in disappointing condition given that it is managed by a 4-star airline. My room door, wooden and creaky, had to be forced shut. Lighting in the room was laughably crooked, no minibar, no free bottled water, furniture very dated, bathtub missing stopper. Room control panel near the bed is difficult to figure out (i.e. no English), even for a seasoned traveler. The check-in staff were friendly, but when I checked out I couldn't find my key they charged me 30rmb for it. In the States I usually keep my keys but in China many Chinese hotels demand return. No big deal, but 30rmb is steep compared to the room price, which is actually the best thing about the hotel. There's also free internet and surprise surprise HBO. It was dirt cheap at under $30 a night, so based on that I am giving this 3 stars rather than 2.	1

TITLE: Worst dining experience ever | TEXT: I have never had such a regrettable dining experience anywhere. They did nothing to accommodate my nephews food dislikes and my wife’s  dairy allergy. There was no salad option offered other than one with cheese and sardine dressing. But the real clincher was the beef dish we ordered for $65….. At that price we figured it was a good quality NY strip. WRONG….no exaggeration, they brought a plate with THREE slices of beef- THREE!! And the measurements were probably- and again no exaggeration- 3 Inches long  by 1 inch wide and a quarter of an inch thick—I couldn’t believe it- $200 later, we left hungry and with the feeling we were ripped off	1
TITLE: Relaxed Fine Dining | TEXT: We chose Hells Kitchen for our one year anniversary. We walked in and were welcomed, escorted to our table and given a drinks and sushi menu. Soaking in the atmosphere you cannot help but notice a quantifying array of pitchforks. I asked a server how many they were but that will remain a mystery.   We then met Caesar- a brilliant server for relaxed fine dining, clearly knowing his role inside out. I would describe him as attentive, cheerful, upbeat, helpful, and incredibly on the ball which led us feeling extremely relaxed and excited for the evening ahead. He initially let us get settled, and once we had chosen the wine he suggested some food.   The wine we went for was a Sauvignon blanc 2022, in the Grgich Hills of Napa Valley, costing us $85, after checking vivino, it was only marked up $20.   We also had complimentary bottled spring water from Tuscany.   To start with we had octopus, tuna tartar, and the wagyu and pork meatballs.  The octopus had been charred, accompanied with delicious sweet tomatoes and potatoes. As someone who doesn’t like seafood and has tried octopus before and haven’t been keen, I would’ve finished the plate.  The tartar was flavoursome, beautiful, and fresh. The corn chips were salty to balance the flavour.  The meatballs were the best meatballs I have ever eaten. The meat was incredibly tender and soft, and seasoned perfectly with herbs. The tomato sauce rich and deep in flavour. .   We chatted and admired the kitchen, had are drinks topped up whilst waiting for our mains. Our glasses were never empty. Our servers were extremely attentive.   They arrived, we both ordered the signature Wellington, with the potato puree, brussel sprouts and macaroni and cheese.   The presentation of the Wellington was simple yet elegant. I just stared for a minute not knowing how to tackle it.  I picked up my knife, pressed it lightly onto the Wellington and my jaw dropped in disbelief. The tenderness of the beef was just wow. I softly cut into my wellington with a smile on my face. I only managed half because of the richness, but that’s my problem, not the wellingtons.  On the drive back I ate the other half like a pork pie and it was equally magnificent.   Sprouts were very rich and crunchy, I couldn’t have sat there and smashed through a bowl of it.  The mac and cheese was slightly underwhelming. It wasn’t ’knock your socks off that’s good Mac and cheese.’ The potato puree was creamy, elegant and yum.   The stars of the show were the Wellington and the starters.  Caesar kindly took an anniversary picture of us, gave us the bill ensuring there is no rush to leave.   We left just before 10 after an amazing 2 hour dining experience, and had a walk in the local area - a lovely part of downtown Miami.	1
TITLE: Excellent | TEXT: Very pleasant and cozy, good location, helpful staff, very good breakfast. Be sure that I will reccomend it to my friends	0
"TITLE: Worth the visit!!! | TEXT: I was very impressed with the Warren G. Harding Presidential Sites.  We took the tour of his house, and listened first hand from the tour guides all about when Harding gave speeches on the ""front porch"".  The house is stunning and is 90+ percent original from years ago when Warren and his wife Florence lived in the house.  The tour guides can answer any questions you have off the top of their heads.  The  Library & Museum was finished in the spring of 2021 and they have a nice gift shop in there too.  They spared no expense in the construction of the building - it is beautiful!!!!  If you are a history buff, this is a must do."	0
TITLE: Intrigued after reading the reviews.... | TEXT: We were looking for a small pub not a modern, chain type place and found it! The reviews pretty much slated a barmaid but we found them very attentive and friendly especially the dark haired lady. Yes 80's music is playing but it's a fun trip down memory lane as we heard a lot of music we haven't heard for years. If I am ever in Berlin again then I would definitely visit the King's Pub again. Try it x	0
TITLE: We Really Like This Place | TEXT: I read some of the reviews and am sorry some seem disappointed. We have been twice and sat at the bar for drinks and dinner. Both times have been exceptional. The second time we were served by the owner. Akhil has an incredible knowledge of food prep and wines. We loved everything we ordered. If they are out of something it is because they only stock fresh for the day. I'm good with that. I do admit we went on weeknights in the winter when things might be a bit slower and there are mostly locals there who all seem to know each other so it was very relaxed. We'll keep going back. Good food, good service and pleasant atmosphere.	1
TITLE: Cold | TEXT: Coffee was bitter and service was ok. Anti-2nd amendment. Pastry was too sweet & just so-so. Clean & neat.	1
TITLE: Odd Duck Austin, at the Chef’s Counter: A Night of Personal, Palate-Driven Play. | TEXT: From the moment you sidle into Odd Duck and slide into the chef’s counter, the meal feels less like a dinner and more like an edible conversation with the kitchen. The kitchen’s intimate choreography—flame, fork, and ferocious curiosity—sets a high bar for tasting-menu storytelling.  This night, seated inches from the heat and bustle, offered a stream of inventive bites that balanced seasonal audacity with comforting textures and precise technique.  The setting amplifies the meal: you’re not just observing the plate, you’re watching how intention becomes taste in real time. The energy from the cooks, the quick taste checks, and the moment-to-moment adjustments lend the tasting a live, improvisational rhythm.  Fresh draft watermelon fresca: A refreshing opener that primes the palate with bright acidity and fruit-forward brightness. The texture contrast and cooling finish likely set a playful, summery tone for the night.  Texas pickles: Expect a bold, tangy punctuation—crisp texture, assertive acidity, and perhaps a touch of sweetness. Pickles here are not an afterthought but a defining bite that signals the kitchen’s love for zesty contrast.  Pork belly slider: A classic anchor that often serves as the night’s emotional anchor—rich, satisfying, and balanced by a crisp exterior and perhaps a sharp pickled accent or herb pop. The slider format promises immediacy and comfort while still leaving room for technique to show.  Cast iron cheddar cornbread: This likely delivers a toasty, caramelized crust with a rich, melty cheddar inside. The cast-iron finish usually adds depth and a slight smokiness, offering a grounded counterpoint to lighter courses.  Redfish ceviche: A bright, citrusy, seafood-forward note that showcases freshness and technique in curing. The ceviche should feel clean, with a nuanced balance of acidity and a touch of brightness to keep things lively.  Thai apple salad: A bright, aromatic interlude—crisp apples, maybe herbs, heat, and a balancing acidity. Expect a playful balance of sweet, sour, and fresh heat, lifting the meal with herbal lift.  Fettuccine shrimp: A pasta course that blends succulent shrimp with a likely buttered, perhaps slightly citrusy sauce. Textural contrast and a clean, seafood-forward core would anchor this plate in comfort while letting seafood flavor shine.  Blackened redfish with mesquite and vanilla bean scoop: This sounds like a bold, smoky main that leans into spice, wood-fire aroma, and a surprising vanilla note—an inventive sweet-smoky finish that creates a memorable, almost mischievous twist.  Final note—Mesquite vanilla bean scoop: Expect a creamy, aromatic end that complements the savory notes with a gentle sweetness, leaving you on a soft, satisfying close.  Odd Duck Austin, experienced from the chef’s counter, delivers a distinctive tasting experience that blends seasonal clarity with adventurous flavor experiments. It rewards diners who embrace curiosity and savor the storytelling arc of a well-curated menu. If you’re craving a night where the kitchen feels like a collaborative partner rather than a distant authority, this counter-seat experience is worth seeking out.	1

TITLE: Nice Italian restaurant in the Fairmont | TEXT: We had a very nice Italian meal at this resturant. Upbeat vibe, good food, adequate wine list and excellent service. Attire was dressy casual.  We dined at about 7 pm on a Sunday night and it was not a problem to get a table. That said,  best to make a reservation.	0
TITLE: Delicious | TEXT: So glad we stopped when passing through. Everything we ordered was delicious and the chowder was amazing. Will be back for sure.	0
TITLE: Check your bill | TEXT: I was really disappointed with my recent visit to Sampan on 10/27. The food itself was delicious, but when I got home and looked over my receipt, I realized I was charged for two meals instead of one for several items. I double-checked to make sure it wasn't something I ordered by mistake--it definitely wasn't.  I am not sure how this is even possible since only one item of each was delivered to our table.  Is it a scam???  The total amount overcharged was $109.   I tried calling and emailing the restaurant to sort it out, but haven't been able to get a response yet. Mistakes happen, but overcharging a customer and not fixing it right away doesn't leave a good impression.   Please double-check your bill before you leave!  I hope management sees this and reaches out so this can be corrected.  Table 54	1

The bar tender Scott was amazing, friendly, attentive and fun! Kept our wine glasses full! Food was fantastic! We were having such a great time I didn’t take any pictures until after. We’ll be back!! Highly recommend!	0
TITLE: 1st Time Visit, in Love with it | TEXT: We went there two weeks ago and honestly fell in love with it. I'm a foodie, scratch kitchen guy, the food was wonderful. Salmon was tender enough that it melted like butter. Ambience was old school Little Italy. It is our new favorite.   As to the service, our service was great, but it was old school. Nothing is very fast. It seems only the owner takes orders and so you wait for him. This is an experience. If you're not ready to order a drink/ app, it was the kind of place where you might wait 10 minutes and then they will check in again-- not 2 minutes, This isn't fast casual. Dinner is the event.	1

TITLE: Perfection! | TEXT: This is worth the extra effort to go.  It was perfection from beginning to end.  I couldn’t decide on the soup so our waiter brought me a trio of samples of the three on the menu.  So thoughtful.  We were there for jazz brunch on Sunday.  Great value for the price.  Be sure to walk the neighborhood afterwards.  So gorgeous.	1
TITLE: Best in Seattle! | TEXT: Easily the best food I have had in the last 10, 20 maybe even 30 years. No exaggeration. My wife and I each did the four courses and were able to sample 8 dishes between us. My favorite was the chilled mussels. It’s like eating a symphony of taste. The rabbit croquettes were outstanding. The crème brûlée cake and the three cheese desserts are both outstanding. Service? So professional. We took our time eating and they treated us like kings. Did I mention the breads? Wow!!!	1
TITLE: Great date night! | TEXT: We went last night for the abbreviated menu and it was delightful.  Perfect service that was both professional and playful.  The smell alone is worth another star.  The food was sublime and the wine pairings were different but matched beautifully.  The chef came by and visited with us and he was lovely.  Beautiful room and a gorgeous kitchen.	1
TITLE: Very good food, service | TEXT: My husband and I made a last minute reservation. The only option on the app was outdoor seating. When we got there, outdoor seating looked comfortable even on a chilly fall evening but we were surprised to be offered the option of indoor seating which we accepted. The food was excellent, arrived quickly, and the service was very good. I also appreciated that the noise level wasn't bad. We'll gladly come back next time we're in town.	1
TITLE: Decent food and service, neither are special. | TEXT: Decent food and service, neither are special.   We arrived at 6 PM with a 6 PM reservation and were asked to wait.  At 6:15 we were seated.  Service was fast and cordial, but not rushed.    I ordered a Cheeseburger ($22) without mayo and my Wife had the Sashimi Tuna Salad ($29).  The burger was actually good and cooked as requested.  It is served with a plate full of fries which are probably good if hot but mine were cold.   My Wife enjoyed the Tuna which is seared on the sides so not technically Sashimi but rather Seared Tuna.   We shared a Key Lime Pie ($10) which was good but small so we should have gotten two.  All of the food is overpriced but most restaurants are these days.	1
TITLE: One of the best restaurants around | TEXT: This restaurant is hands down one of the best places I've ever been for a meal. The service is impressive but the food, the food is absolutely some of the best I've ever eaten. I can't say enough about the entire place. If you are within a 50 mile range take the drive there. You will not be disappointed.	0
TITLE: Excellent food and good service! | TEXT: We tried this cute coffee shop and cafe for breakfast. The most delicious breakfasts are served here. The TikTok Sammie was delicious with sausage and cheese. The omelets were filled with fresh vegetables and a choice of meats. The grits were delicious and creamy. Service was excellent and the food was served promptly and piping hot. Coffee was good too. We will definitely be back!	1
TITLE: good food | TEXT: Good food affordable prices and friendly service floors always filthy i seen a bum right out front of their door he wasnt eating so he had no bussines being there I really like their food so i give it a five.	1
TITLE: Great customizations available | TEXT: Stopped in recently for a late working lunch. Sat at the bar because I needed a charge. It was mostly quiet but steady due to the time.   Service was good - bartender was able to accommodate allergies easily and graciously.   I had the blackened shrimp - so good and very filling. I wasn’t able to finish all the fries which were also so yummy.   I can’t believe I haven’t tried this place yet - I will definitely be back.	1
TITLE: #1 North End Italian | TEXT: Best Italian food I’ve ever had including Italy! Everything we had was incredible and the service was first class. I was quite worried as we couldn’t get a reservation but walked up and got there early. Will be on my list for my next Boston visit!	0
TITLE: Great Latte | TEXT: We ordered 2 latte's off the app and when we pulled into the store everything was ready on the counter. Super service.	1
TITLE: disappointed | TEXT: This place is a gem in my book, exact during my last visit. My wife gets salmon every time we go which is more than 2 times a month. The place is expensive. My wife had to send her food back 3 times. The waitress basically was too busy to take my entire order every time I asked for something. My wife had to ask for a fork 3 times because the waitress forgot. They comped our meal, but after the sideshow with our loyalty account, it will be awhile before we return (we convinced our friends and now I regret it)	1
TITLE: Some of the BEAT Italian food I have ever had!!!! | TEXT: Highly recommend this place, Great food,  Great atmosphere & Great service!!!! The one draw back is lack of signage can make it a little hard to find but worth looking for!!!!	1
TITLE: High-priced excellence | TEXT: The food here is amazing. Everything prepared to perfection. The baked potato was huge and the steak was cooked perfectly. The only issue is the price is astronomical. The porterhouse steak was $110. Table surface was superb.	1
TITLE: A wedge of happiness. | TEXT: My family came to this cute restaurant for dinner. The service was excellent!! The food was very delicious and the live music was very good! We ordered some fried gater. I took a bite of it and had to spit it out lol. Probably just psychological. My family liked it. I ordered the Wedge salad and I really liked it.	0
TITLE: Left poorer, but still hungry | TEXT: We had been trying to get a reservation here for ages and were really disappointed by our experience. There were a couple positives -- staff were lovely and Audrey's wine pairing, while poured with a stingy hand, was well planned and full of interesting choices.   The food was the real dissapointment. First, there just wasn't enough of it. We left hungry and got fries on the way home. Not what you want paying more than $500 for dinner. The food ranged from pretty good -- the rockfish, the blue cheese puff -- to pretty bad -- under seasoned and dry pork belly (like how do you even make pork belly too dry?). Nothing we ate was memorable in a good way.  We've been to a lot of Michelin star restaurants and I have no idea what happened here. Is the chef doing Paleo? Give us some pasta or a potato or something more than tiny slivers of fish and radishes for all this money. I know everything is more expensive these days but a dinner like this shouldn't leave people hungry.	1
TITLE: More, I want more! | TEXT: Wow I am glad I found this place.  I was in town, we were all hungry. I saw this place out of the corner of my eye and something told me to pull in. So I did and I was super happy with the quality of the food. Although the salmon could have been cooked about 2 to 3 minutes longer, the flavors and the veggies totally rocked. I WILL BE BACK !	1
TITLE: Skip it. Touristy and overpriced | TEXT: I’ve been walking past it for a few years and my sister wished to try it on her birthday. Dirty martini was made with black olives. Huh? And for $15! Sent that back. Flatbread was room temperature. Sent that back. What I won’t do is go back. Save your $$ and go elsewhere.	1
TITLE: Over rated don’t waste your your hard earn money | TEXT: This was one of the worst experiences I’ve ever seen in portland. There’s a fantastic food scene in Portland and I would highly recommend checking out anything else. The food is yummy but very expensive and the service might be the worst I’ve ever come across. Save your money and check out anywhere else! Pretentious, entitled, and over rated! Do better!	0

TITLE: Good spot for lunch | TEXT: On a whirlwind tour of San Francisco for visiting relatives, we stopped here for lunch.  It was a lovely afternoon, and we really appreciated the view of the sea lion docks and bay from the dining room.  Service was wonderful, very friendly and attentive.  Our food was good.  I had the salmon burger with fries.  It was quite tasty.  We also tried the pulled pork sandwich, very good.  Prices were reasonable for touristy San Francisco.  I would return next time I'm playing tourist in the city.	0
TITLE: Over priced dog food. | TEXT: Gravy with tamales? Wth... gross, over priced dog food with gravy, weirdest combo I've seen. I feel robbed I paid, and will never ever come back. To make things worse they have a comedian here that doesn't fit a nice Latino restaurant.	1
TITLE: Lounge Has It All | TEXT: Nicely crafted and creative drinks, delicious food served up in a historic and beautiful setting, with stellar views over the city. I enjoyed their cheeseburger as well as several other items during our stay at the Bellevue; all were excellent. They offer a sweet happy hour which includes some drinks and some food. The service is impeccable, but also very welcoming and friendly. I enjoyed the drinks, food and ambience so much, I kept going back; it was that great.	0

TITLE: Ok but not great | TEXT: We saw that the restaurant had good reviews so we gave it a shot. Have nothing negative to say, but not anything good either. So 3 stars as I consider it average. Had dumplings and Fried rice with mushrooms. Price a little high for average food	0
TITLE: Not good at all | TEXT: Ask for my cheese to be scrambled with eggs didn’t add any cheese at all. I called and the manager argued me down that he did and I took pictures. Bad experience. Everyone makes mistakes but why not try to fix as a business owner.	1
"TITLE: Not what it used t o be.................. | TEXT: First time to the new Suze.......they did a nice job with the new location; very pleasant and one of the few places that wasn't so dang loud that you could not carry on a conversation.  The server (Perry) did a great job.   The orkra special appetizer was certainly plentiful, hot, and  fresh however the dressing (Madras curry buttermilk ranch dressing)   ""dip"" lacked any hint of curry. The Porcini Pappardella Pasta was short on meat sauce unlike previous times my wife enjoyed that entrée.  The special seared dbl bone-in Heritage pork chop would have been great had it not been swimming in jus....the broth simply dissolved the polenta, wiped out the flavor of any apple chutney and soaked away the otherwise enjoyment of any distinct flavor of the ""char"" on the chop.  On the positive side was an outstanding Sticky Toffee Pudding.    Wish the overall meal could have been better as all the meals had been in the past.  Price was right at $140 for the two of us but considering all the restaurant choices available there really is no reason to go back."	1

TITLE: Never again, they’re lazy and lousy… | TEXT: The service was terrible. I ordered my food online and I arrived after the time it was supposed to be ready. It wasn't ready when I got there and the lady from the bar was running around asking questions. She finally came to me and asked what I had ordered. I showed her my receipt. She left and came back after like 7 more minutes and let me know that it will be like 10 mins until my order was done. I asked if they just started on my order and she said yes. The worse customer service ever. She didn’t try to make up for their wrong doing or anything. She left me sitting at the bar for 20 mins and asked if I wanted a water. Crazy right? I know.. My food comes out and she hands it to me and tells me to have a goodnight… I’m irritated so I’m just like whatever. I’m really appalled at the lack of customer service here. Then I’m at my car sitting and a Asian lady, whose been eating at the bar for most of the night not assisting and just answering questions, came to my car with like 3-4 more people and said the tab wasn’t paid. I said okay, let me pay it but your employee said bye and goodnight so don’t try to make it like it’s my fault. Y’all dropped the ball tonight and the only thing you could do was come to my car disrespectfully about this bill. And I told her that she should be taking money off got the inconvenience but she didn’t want to hear that. She blamed the kitchen. I told her that is not my problem because it’s not. And I told her I would not be coming back. Too much money to spend on gold where people are rude and don’t know hot to correct their wrongs.	1
TITLE: Convenient for Fort Jackson. | TEXT: This is a nice place to stay if you are going to some activities at Fort Jackson.    The hotel is comfortable and convenient to several of the Fort gates.     It is near the interstate and access is very easy.      The hotel staff is friendly and helpful and the rooms are very nice.	0
TITLE: Harding Presidential Sites | TEXT: We had a great visit to the Warren G Harding Presidential Library and Memorial. The Library (aka Museum) is quite small compared to other presidential libraries, but does a good job telling the story of Harding's short presidency. Tours of his home are only offered on the hour, so we had to miss that, but did take photos from the outside. We also visited the Harding Memorial in the cemetery, which was quite impressive. If you're passing by Marion, Ohio, take a break from your drive and stop by to see the presidential sites.	0

TITLE: Great Dinner! Great Server! | TEXT: Wonderful Meal, Great Server, and We Enjoyed the Outdoor Seating …  Had dinner here last night, did not have a reservation and the bar area was full. However, we were seated promptly outside, which was our preference. Delightfully friendly server, Anthony (see photo) greeted us and was a definite add to the dining experience — as he knew the menu well, made great recommendations, and was genuinely friendly and eager to please. Thanks Anthony!  Food at this restaurant was well prepared, very tasty, and portion size was satisfying. We started with the grilled artichokes which we had had before and they are fantastic, with a nice aïoli dip. My wife had a vegetable plate and a crab cake. She makes a great crab cake, but admitted that this crab cake may have been better than hers. All crab, no filling. Outstanding! I had a marinated ribeye and baked potato. Both were delicious. Both of us had enough food that we brought home leftovers which I enjoyed for lunch.   Had a latte for dessert which was an exceptionally good cup of coffee, and the Key lime pie was memorable.  A great meal. This is a restaurant we need to go to more often.	1
TITLE: Fantastic Dinner | TEXT: We loved this except for one dish.  The margarita, chips and salsa, guac, ceviche, quesadilla were all amazing.  The tuna taco was surprisingly not good.  However, I would definitely go back.  Overall, loved it!	0
TITLE: Farm to Table Excellence | TEXT: Perhaps the best meal I had in Philadelphia. Very large restaurant with big patio and several inside dining areas plus a large bar. Well appointed and elegant but still warm and welcoming atmosphere. We enjoyed a meal of roasted cauliflower with coconut curry, garbanzo beans and quinoa. Along with lamb bolognese Pappardelle with whipped ricotta. Their chive and cheddar biscuits are to die for.  Wine options are well chosen and multiple by the glass offerings	0
TITLE: Groups get overpriced quotes | TEXT: I understand that restaurants may be desperate to get  people to return back to their venues due to COVID but that should be all the reason for exemplary service.  I reached out to Bluebird for a group reservation for 14 professional women celebrating women's month. Due to the group size the planner mandated that we have the $75 prix fixe menu. 1st Issue: planner did not ask which appetizers, entrees and desserts we wanted to choose. 2nd Issue: if I ordered the appetizer, entree and dessert a la carte, the most expensive items totaled $67. Why is the prix fixe more expensive than ordering the same items a la carte? I informed the planner I want to sub out the meal options she chose for more appealng items on the larger menu. 3rd Issue: Bluebird priced the prix fixe with the new options I chose at $90. Meanwhile the most expensive items still totaled $67 if purchased a la carte! I complained and the planner said the upcharge is to ensure everyone's food comes out at the same time. That's bizarre! Is she implying Bluebird is not used to handling groups?  And why is there a $63 administrative charge in the contract?? Essentially Bluebird tried to charge $23 more per prix fixe meal per person plus the $63 admin fee equating to a $385 upcharge. Disappointing and poor service for a restaurant that I perceived as prestigious!!	1
TITLE: Date night with my Bride | TEXT: Excellent staff and service.  Our meal was amazing.  Seafood tower blew our mind.  The GM and head Chef came over to thank us for our visit.  Great touch!!!	0
TITLE: Best part of my trip to San Fran | TEXT: Fantastic, food was incredible, but what stood out was the service and friendliest staff. I dined solo sat at the bar, and the bartender was extremely welcoming and chatted to me throughout my meal and gave great recommendations for my stay in the city, despite having a busy job of making all the drinks for the restaurant. Cocktails here were also fantastic!	1
TITLE: Great Burgers By The Marina | TEXT: This place is one of the best in the area not only for the burgers but for the location. It's located right along the marina so if you sit outside you get the added bonus of a great view. The cheeseburger was really good. It was decent size and had a good taste. The garlic fries were also good on the side. Their menu is fairly large with many different choices for breakfast and other types of sandwiches for lunch. Overall a great place to eat not only for the food but also for the view. A very relaxing place to eat.	0

The staff at a.kitchen were helpful from the moment we asked for a reservation, a few weeks before -- coming up with a three-course prix fixe menu that accommodated everyone's tastes and dietary needs. The service was attentive, the pace was leisurely, the noise level low enough so that we could all talk....and the celebrated natural wine list was as good as we expected. We couldn't have asked for a better morning-after meal or a more thoughtful presentation. We look forward to visiting for drinks and dinner on another visit to Philadelphia.	1
