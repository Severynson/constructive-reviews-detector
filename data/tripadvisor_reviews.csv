They tend to be very skimpy when it comes to your food. I paid for two beef, cheese & rice burritos which the cook put about 5 pieces of rice in each burrito! I called to speak with the manager and he said it was a mistake (yeah right) and that he wouldn't charge me for rice on my next order! He should've been offering two new burritos, if that's the best you can do, I will not be back! Also, they limit you on the salsa to go, you only get one per burrito and it's only a teaspoon.  Terrible and cheap! Try other places that believe in giving you your money's worth.|en|https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g33130-d513544-r928522578-Reviews-Arroyo_s_Mexican_Cafe-Stockton_California.html?m=66827#review928522578|897teeg|Solo travel|2023-12-31|1.0

I have been a loyal customer since the 70's and have followed them when they relocated. Yes the food is that good,the homemade  tortillas fresh salsa available in medium and hot. This food is made with love of three generations. I recommend  the combination plate with the beef taco,chili relleno and beef enchilada,the gravy is good enough to jump through a plate glass window without breaking it. Over the years I have tried every dish at least twice and have  come to this choice.If your in a rush try the beef,bean and cheese burrito filling and fast made with love.I have been to thousands of restaurants all over the world tried cuisine in Mexico and Arroyos is 5 star in satisfaction and taste bud joy|en|https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g33130-d513544-r653951321-Reviews-Arroyo_s_Mexican_Cafe-Stockton_California.html?m=66827#review653951321|gregorygP3959WQ|Friends getaway|2019-02-28|

No one was drunk, we were peacefully enjoying our treats, I hadn’t even drank 20% of my drink. She may have been going through something personal because when I asked her name, she raised her eyebrows, swung her head, and raised her voice to say, “Would you just like to talk to the manager?!” We accepted the offer, but regardless, will never return. So sad. When we first arrived and ordered our initial drinks, the patrons that left the seats we took were bragging about drinking a whole bottle of Don Julio 70 between the two of them along with the same bar tender. At that point, the bartender accidentally took our full drinks and dumped them. So we mentioned the error and she supplied replacements. As I said, I didn’t drink mine and my husband finished his by the time of her episode. The manager explained they had just had some ABC training and they were buckling down. This would be entirely understandable. However, the bar tender’s  judgement was misplaced and targeted. That, in addition to her horrendous decorum, has destroyed the establishment’s rapport with us.|en|https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g33130-d2224396-r884349129-Reviews-Waterloo-Stockton_California.html?m=66827#review884349129|TDiede1|Friends getaway|2023-04-30|2.0

Furikake fries: unusual Japanese spices served with two uncommon sauces, quoth the menu.  Blah.  Flavorless.  Sauces seemed mostly like ketchup with a bit of BBQ sauce and a mayo.  Unconsumable. BUT...the wood oven baked Khachapuri was quite tasty, although it could have used a much bigger dose of garlic and butter.  Again, unusual, with, of all things, a soft egg yolk proudly in the center.  Now, HOW this item appeared on what is a pretty standard fare menu is anyone's guess. The ""Ora"" king salmon was perfectly cooked and served on a plentiful bed of mixed vegetables.  Would be enhanced with some balsamic glaze, and that could be served in a cup on the side. The pineapple crisp dessert was another item that sounded great but whose execution left lots to be desired.   Topped with a rubberized piece of pineapple that could have served well as a drain closure.  Ice cream was OK, but they left the crisp off the crisp.  Oh, well... Pleasant, helpful, and attentive service personnel. Limited and not outrageously priced wine and beer offerings; easy free parking. Restroom could use some policing."|en|https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g33130-d6031429-r1016921161-Reviews-Market_Tavern-Stockton_California.html?m=66827#review1016921161|204williamd|Solo travel|2025-06-30|

Both food and service leave much to be desired. Two different steaks were still quite good, but a Caesar salad on the menu with Little Gem lettuce was ordinary romaine and in two “cut it yourself” slabs. Service was lackadaisical, wave and wave to get your server, drinks wrong, wrong steak sauce. Large slice of roast beef looked nice, but why swimming in a deep pool of beef broth? That is not “au jus”. The Japanese fries are just OK, most steak places have better, crispier, or matchstick, etc. “Loaded” baked potato was certainly that, if you are into a thousand calorie smothered vegetable. Curiously meager wine list with few cabs, the preferred steak wine of many people. So all and all if you’re looking for a NY or Las Vegas steakhouse experience, this is not even close.|en|https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g33130-d11913784-r776970675-Reviews-Prime_Table_Steakhouse-Stockton_California.html?m=66827#review776970675|Visgilio|Family|2020-11-30|

Had heard so much about the new development and a new waterfront park , had to visit . Took the ferry from San Francisco and it’s just a 10 minute ride with spectacular views.  An employee on the ferry told us about Mersea Restaurant and Bar and its unusual building of recycled rail cars . The restaurant looks like an indoor outdoor restaurant with fabulous views . It’s not a regular sit down restaurant , you order at the counter and your food is delivered to your table .  We ordered two Fish and chips and one taco plate . The fish and chips were so sooo  greasy , so greasy that  they had to place napkins under the fish to absorb the grease . I have never had Fish and Chips brought to my table with a side of napkins under the fish before , the fish was flaky but had no flavor because of all the grease . The Fish and Chips are served with lemon and a curry tartar sauce that didn’t sit well with the fish at all . Who ever thought of that combination  should shelve it . .. the serving of chips from one order to the other was very inconsistent . My table mate received 6 chips under her fish and I received about 12 . What gives ?? My other table mate who ordered the tacos said they were just below average and wouldn’t order those again if he returned . He is Hispanic and disappointed that these taco were actually recommended . The salsa was commercial bought and not  homemade as you might expect from a restaurant that is touted as original . The indoor ambience is just what you might expect of a stripped down rail car… boring. The employees are friendly but distant and they never check up on you . If you want water you get it yourself . The island needs more options as Mersea is just an average restaurant with mediocre food . The food does not come out at the same time one table mate received her fish and chips 15 minutes before the next food arrived …. Forget the 4 and 5 stars !  The island is in a food desert unfortunately .|en|https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g60713-d13497261-r1038400430-Reviews-Mersea_Restaurant_Bar-San_Francisco_California.html?m=66827#review1038400430|Sightseer37900691172|Friends getaway|2025-11-30|

The owner and her team welcomed us warmly, found space for our group, and made sure everyone was comfortable and well taken care of throughout the night. The service was attentive without being rushed, and you could tell they genuinely cared that we had a great experience.  They even brought out additional umbrellas and helped move them around to protect us from the bright sun that day. The atmosphere was lively and inviting--exactly what you want for a celebration--and the scenery, with that one-of-a-kind San Francisco backdrop, made it even better.

For creativity, intelligence, dedication, flavours and sheer brilliance of the individual dishes, the answer is yes.  But I walked away feeling somewhat empty.  Reflecting on it, I think the dishes were individually brilliant but as a whole, it did not convey a sense of a journey or a story.  Modern Cali-Korean food is fine but where is it going?  And the service is not consistent and it was akin to a bistro service.  For the sort of cash Benu is asking for, the front of house needs to be improved significantly.  If this restaurant was in France, it would have lost 2 stars for the patchy service.|en|https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g60713-d1898383-r950037362-Reviews-Benu-San_Francisco_California.html?m=66827#review950037362|Mobile589348|Business|2024-05-31|

So glad we did! We figured the only way to better understand San Francisco's culinary fine dining history was to trace it right back near the start. Chef Gary Danko was among the early wave of James Beard Award winning chefs in San Francisco and later became part of the first generation of Michelin-starred chefs in the city once the Michelin Guide began rating San Francisco restaurants. I've read some Yelp reviews calling his food ""old school"". After our experience there, I'd say it's more of a throwback to the golden age of fine dining. You won't find trendy hyper-local experimental cuisine with designer eatable floral pedals in mini Japanese pottery and expensive foam that pretends to be flavor. Instead you'll find a rolling cheese cart, white tablecloths, impeccable service and sauces that use classic French techniques (béarnaise, fumets, veloutés). All paying homage to classic French cooking. The menu offers 3, 4, or 5-course prix‑fixe menu with ample choices in each category. We chose the 3 and 4. We enjoyed every dish. Stand Outs: Roast Lobster with Potato Purée, Edamame, Peas, Asparagus, and Tarragon Jus - Tender lobster, nicely seasoned and comforting potato purée and velvety tarragon jus. The Glazed Oysters with Osetra Caviar. So good! I could've eaten 3 more. Plump perfectly cooked oysters topped with a generous amount of Osetra caviar nestled in a silky leek fondue and a light lettuce cream. Buttery but not rich and with a wonderful briny ocean finish. Filet of Beef with Potato Gratin, King Trumpet Mushrooms. Tender and juicy that paired perfectly with the bone marrow béarnaise. The Horseradish Crusted Salmon: We had questions - how is a ""horseradish"" crust so airy and fluffy? Then we consulted with our server who spilled the beans. It's the Egg Whites folded in with the horseradish.  Add a tangy grain mustard sauce to balance the rich salmon, and you've got an old-school French combo. IMHO, in today's flavor landscape, mustard doesn't get enough love. Let's talk dessert!! Pastry Chef Killian Guillotin grew up in Brittany, France, and  cut his teeth in top French kitchens before sharing his magic here. The Baked Chocolate Soufflé with two sauces. Light as a cloud with just enough rich-sweetness to say dessert's in the house. And don't get me started with the vanilla bean crème anglaise and Belgian chocolate sauces. Worth every calorie!! Is Gary Danko old school? Maybe. But in the way your favorite vintage wine is old. Complex, full bodies, and full of finesse . Happy Eating!!"|en|https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g60713-d370412-r1021482826-Reviews-Restaurant_Gary_Danko-San_Francisco_California.html?m=66827#review1021482826|h2oblue|Couples|2025-07-31|

We had the set menu Steak Tartare and Striploin (fatty but to be expected) and Sticky Toffee Pudding. We thoroughly enjoyed the food, there was a nice busy ambience and feel to the restaurant. We were close enough to a window to have a view of the park. Visiting from England and Abu Dhabi we were celebrating my daughters 21st birthday. Every other place we have been to in New York have acknowledged this and we have loved the welcoming feel. The Bluebird dinner was the real big event for us and we were soo disappointed with the service. We were greeted with a ‘Yes’ I almost wanted to apologise for being there. The maitre d walked away without speaking to us - we kind of figured we should follow! Most restaurants begin with a Good Evening and Welcome at the very least. A waiter asked if we wanted water (we later noticed everyone else having tap water) and swiftly brought a bottle of still. No smile, no niceties, no welcome. Next our server came to us, perfectly amicable and perfunctory but no introduction or welcome. We ordered our food and drinks. Food came very quickly as starters were both cold. I asked a waiter if we could have our drinks, he explained they were busy. I explained this was a special occasion and so far it had been less than special. To his credit a few minutes later the drinks appeared. We received our steaks and the manger noted we had no steak knives, which she quickly corrected. Mains cleared and deserts promptly brought out. When we had finished our desert our server asked if we wanted anything or just the check! By this time I was totally incensed. Let alone feel this was a special occasion, we were now feeling an inconvenience and she just wanted us to leave. 250 dollars for 2 - I at least expect to feel welcome. Perhaps I am wrong to expect a little more personalised attention at a restaurant of this standard. Clearly it is just a get them in and out and take their money business model. I did not leave a tip and funnily enough no one asked me if everything was ok for me to put my thoughts across at the end of the evening. A shame that such a special occasion will be tainted by a lack of attention and personal experience.|en|https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g60763-d15058185-r863732002-Reviews-Bluebird_London_NYC-New_York_City_New_York.html?m=66827#review863732002|Mama_Five1|Family|2022-10-31|

But our afternoon tea was overpriced and poorly prepared.  Nothing seemed to have been created in-house; the pastries were gummy and the chicken curry was unrecognizable.

Due to the group size the planner mandated that we have the $75 prix fixe menu. 1st Issue: planner did not ask which appetizers, entrees and desserts we wanted to choose. 2nd Issue: if I ordered the appetizer, entree and dessert a la carte, the most expensive items totaled $67. Why is the prix fixe more expensive than ordering the same items a la carte? I informed the planner I want to sub out the meal options she chose for more appealng items on the larger menu. 3rd Issue: Bluebird priced the prix fixe with the new options I chose at $90. Meanwhile the most expensive items still totaled $67 if purchased a la carte! I complained and the planner said the upcharge is to ensure everyone's food comes out at the same time. That's bizarre! Is she implying Bluebird is not used to handling groups?  And why is there a $63 administrative charge in the contract?? Essentially Bluebird tried to charge $23 more per prix fixe meal per person plus the $63 admin fee equating to a $385 upcharge.

Such is the case of Artiete which has been awarded 1 star for multiple years although totally undeserving in my opinion.  Wife and I arrived 6:15pm last Saturday night and requested one of the many empty outside tables.  We were told they were all pre-reserved and were ushered to a table in the darkest area of the restaurant that already resembles a dungeon.  The hostess begrudgingly moved us to a more acceptable table.  As others have noted, the background music, which included Latin Rap, was oppressively loud.  We ordered the grouper and snapper dishes and both lacked taste and were otherwise undistinguishable. When the server asked our likings for dessert, I ordered flan and coffee.  The server indicated the coffee machine was broken and coffee was not available.  In over 70 years of restaurant dining, I never experienced a restaurant not being able to serve coffee.  So we left unfulfilled noting the outside tables were still vacant 1 1/2 hours after we first arrived.  $24 cocktails and limited expensive parking are further reasons one should patronize alternative restaurants.|en|https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g34438-d9818282-r1004612446-Reviews-Ariete-Miami_Florida.html?m=66827#review1004612446|Resort61809827413|Couples|2025-04-30|

I expected higher quality food than what they are serving. I am allergic to cilantro, so I asked for the guacamole to be prepared without cilantro - apparently the chef told the server that the guacamole is premade so making a guacamole without the cilantro was not happening. If this is a Michelin star restaurant surely the chef behind the scene should be more than capable to make a guacamole without cilantro quickly and without hesitation…. but no… apparently this was too challenging for them - or maybe it was just laziness, I don’t know! After that I ordered the Al Pastor tacos, which were basic at best. The meat was dry, the tortilla was bland, and the taco itself lacked flavor. My husband ordered the egg tostada and that had far too much salt. On top of this they had us sat outside in the dead heat with leaves blowing all over our table and food off of the umbrella above. We chose not to order mains and left to find another place to dine. Disappointing. Surely if they keep up this they will not earn another star in the future.|en|https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g34438-d25723361-r1006875558-Reviews-Los_Felix-Miami_Florida.html?m=66827#review1006875558|A3224CGvanessar|Family|2025-05-31|1.0

A few things: - This isn’t a Mexican restaurant. It’s meso-American centered around different types of corn. The head chef and all the kitchen staff are Colombian. - As expected for a Michelin starred restaurant, it was very inventive and we found almost every dish incredible. The flavors were complex and the presentation was amazing. The only exception was one dish (the catch of the day), which was too salty in our opinion, but that was an outlier of the 8 dishes we tried. The highlights were the tacos al pastor, smoked trumpet mushrooms, crab arepa, and carnitas. - The service was on point.

I was ignored by the first female and was given a puzzled look that they can't be opened. After I went around to seek attention from the other staff she rudely stated both bathrooms are not available, after I asked why she said "" they just are "". I asked to see what would cause them to be unusable but could only feel discriminated as she added no urgency to the issue. She then asked if I was management to even request to see the inside of the bathrooms. As a LONG TIME CUSTOMER. I suggest to keep your client based loyal to address this issue as it leaves a bad image on the franchise. I left feeling ""I didn't have it my way "". And that's just a bowl movement.

Hadn't been in years.  Heard they got a Michelin star.  I have to question that a little having dined at Mich star restaurants.  They walk you thru the kitchen to the bar if you are early.  Could be cool.  But I'm not sure this is a wow you kitchen.  Then the bar and the most UN-Michelin thing I've seen.  Two of the guys ordered bourbon neat.  I think it was Blantons so a good one.  Both glasses were filthy.  Disgustingly dirty.  They pointed it out and the bartender simply poured the bourbon from the dirty glasses to two cleaner ones.  Not new pours.  NOT Michelin.  He tried to wipe the rim of my dirty wine glass with a bar rag as is in ""a rag that was used to wipe the bar"".  I asked for a new glass.  Once in the dining room, the food is good.  The team wait staff arrangement not as much.  Haphazard and disorganized.  Gumbo  had good flavor but was really just a brown roux gravy w nothing in it.  The boudin stuffed quail was good.  Maybe the ratio was too boudin forward.  And the dessert soufflé was a great take on a bread pudding that was made light w a nice layer of meringue.  They stress ""jackets recommended"".  Go all or nothing.  It wasn't the norm and the plastic perma inflated birthday ""balloons"" were a little Chucky Cheesy for me.  All in all....good.  But Michelin?

Louis the owner was so friendly- the food was delicious.  I thought I was ""home"" and my grandmother was in the kitchen. We started with a rum punch...but this wasn't any old rum punch...this was a really West Indian Rum punch...tastes so good but packs a punch!!!  We had the food served family style & we ordered the sweet fish, curry, jerk chicken, peleau...OMG everything was delicious!!!! The menu changes daily so you have to read the chalkboard...I was hoping for Roti...but it wasn't on the chalkboard.  However, Louis did tell me if I call ahead he'd make sure it was on the menu the next time I came by. Service was good- drinks arrived quickly- food took a little time...but if you go with good company the wait won't matter, because it's worth the wait!!! They are open seasonally so call ahead if its not boating season...if the weather is good they may be there.

All of my guests raved about the food and the service. I had left the food selection up to Louis, the owner, and he chose well - seafood peleau, pork loin tender enough to cut with a fork, and coq au vin, also tender and delicious. The food was plentiful, and also included salad and dessert. Lunch was served hot and on schedule. We brought our own wine and paid a small corkage fee. Louis was great to work with during the planning stage, and always replied quickly to my phone calls, texts and emails. Wonderful experience all around and we will be back. Oh, and the location is very cool, too.

I remember eating at Xochimilco Cafe as a child very fondly and was looking forward to revisiting a very  old friend. The food was well above-average and the portions were enormous. I ordered the two tostada plate, choosing guacamole and chicken. Both tostadas were built on hot, freshly-made tortillas and were heaped with cheese, lettuce, tomatoes, and sour cream. I enjoyed them very much. Rice, beans and fresh, hot flour tortillas were also served and were delicious. My companion ordered a three-item combination plate, that, as it came with Chile Verde and Chile Colorado, was really a 5-item plate. It was an absolutely enormous platter of food. While she ate only a small percentage of it, she proclaimed it as delicious. The dining room hadn't changed very much since 1970, and the downtown Stockton location is far from attractive.  But the food made the trip worthwhile.|en|https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g33130-d2231110-r624030723-Reviews-Xochimilco_Cafe-Stockton_California.html?m=66827#review624030723|592rickh|Friends getaway|2018-09-30|2.0

What a nice find! It wasn't crowded that Sunday mid-afternoon, so we were seated immediately.  The waitress was friendly and patient as we looked over the sizeable menu.  Our party started out with a bread-time appetizer (sausage, cheese, bread, and saurkraut).  Then we all settled on pork schnitzels:  two hunter (jaeger) and one Berlin (which had a sort of a Doener sauce on it).  The Berlin schnitzel was quite appealing and had a different and interesting taste to it.  We could choose two side dishes out of a page's worth of them in the menu.  The spaetzle turned out to be surprisingly good, as were the croquettes (a cousin to tater tots).  The schnitzels were all good-sized -- two of our party ended up taking half of their schnitzels home in a box. Dinner for three came out to about $75, before tax and tips, which wasn't too bad.  Note that German Guys does add 3% to the bill when payment is made with a credit card. There is free parking around the building, which itself is actually not all that large. Overall, the meals were really good, and we definitely will see about visiting again when we're next in town.  One of the staff remarked that they were thinking of moving closer to town, and your reviewer can't help but think that would be a good idea.

We were disappointed in little ways. Husband thought his cordon bleu was a little small. And possibly from a frozen food box. The salad was good and so was the red cabbage. My sauerkraut with mushrooms was not as tasty as I thought it should be. I thought there should be some pork flavor in it to tone it down. My fish fillet was breaded and crispy. I didn’t expect it to be breaded. The fish was good in itself. The staff were were very nice. It was crowded for a Sunday afternoon. I expected to reminisce to an Old town German quiet place with old German music quietly in the background. This place is youthful and lively!  The beer looked good!

Farm-to-table with an elegant twist! The options featured a unique combination of flavors and ingredients- persimmon and sweet potato sold me! And each dish was more amazing than the next. As we were traveling, we just ordered appetizers and were completely satisfied with everything. Of course we had to have the sweet potato and persimmons side. Both ingredients sweet, but not in competition with each other, while the miso added the perfect punch. The roasted beer with smoked halibut mousse appetizer was divine. Beets were cooked perfectly, the buttermilk dressing a perfect complement, but the trout roe added the pop. We also ordered the grilled chicory salad, a bitter and tangy partner to the previous plates. But the shrimp carpaccio was out of this world. Fresh, fresh, fresh shrimp, pounded flat and cut into a rectangle, made a base for the pile of excitement on top: pickled persimmon, radish, furikake, crispy rice, and chili crunch. Yes indeed, farm to table over the top. Then there was the service. Our server Xandra was efficient, friendly, and attentive without being overbearing. Even the bus boy Kameron offered excellent service. The place filled up while we were there, but we may as well have been the only guests - we never needed for anything during our very pleasant visit. Highly recommend this sophisticated yet down-to-earth restaurant in the Citizen Hotel downtown. Wish I lived in Sacramento!|en|https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g32999-d1370564-r1039953680-Reviews-Grange_Restaurant_Bar-Sacramento_California.html?m=66827#review1039953680|Z6755WCkatherinej|Couples|2025-10-31|

I brought my wife here for a (belated, because it takes awhile to get a reservation!🤣) birthday dinner, just the other night. I've rarely experienced such a warm, welcoming and pleasant atmosphere. It really was just like a dinner party. Every single person in this place seemed to be having a blast. The food was wonderful, of course (when I die, let it be by drowning in a pool of white truffle sabayon). What really made the difference though? The complete lack of pretension or stuffiness. This place is run and operated by a group of folks who clearly love the heck out of what they do. You can tell they're like a family. I simply had a wonderful time. That's it! I would happily go back and cannot wait for the opportunity. I am a father of two. I do not get nights out. I do not have a life. Not really. I am very thankful for the staff at the Kitchen for giving us another lovely memory and another dining experience to look forward to repeating.

We ordered seconds of 3 dishes, followed up asking for the status, and at the end of the evening was told the kitchen was closed, so they can no longer prepare the dishes we requested. They blamed it on new staff they're training, but that's not an acceptable excuse for a Michelin star restaurant! If I wanted unreliability and poor service, I would've had dinner at a fast food restaurant instead. They also changed policies and no longer allow you to take your leftover bread or chips home. Does it end up in the trash? Feels like a huge waste. If you hire new staff, please train them appropriately, or find new staff that can deliver a basic level of service in a restaurant such as submitting orders. The whole night was ruined by this experience and our 10 year anniversary is now a giant disappointment.|en|https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g32999-d492400-r897275390-Reviews-The_Kitchen_Restaurant-Sacramento_California.html?m=66827#review897275390|WazzapWendy|Couples|2023-06-30|

Very engaging chef and staff. Love the ideas that you can walk around interacting with the chefs and the repeat of what we like. So much food and all so good, 3 of us had one repeat and it was so great. The cocktail pairing was interesting, something to try at least once. I had the mock tail pairing and it was fun. A lot of wines and liquor that you don't see in other places. It's not your typical quiet and reserved atmosphere, it is fun, energetic ambiance. You can cook next to the chefs and help prepare the food if you want to see how that feels. You need to book 4 months ahead and have some flexibility with your dates because the reservation is gone within minutes.

My second time there and last. The best item wasn't on the menu,  the amuse bouche. It was a mushroom soup and fantastic. Also delicious, the Dungeness crab crepe. The Cauliflower starter was disappointed as was the diakon radish dish. Both looked incredible but didn't taste so. The pasta dish with truffle was twofold. The pasta was delicious BUT the copious amount of truffle the chef grated onto each plate not only looked disgusting but tasted disgusting. I have been to Italy,  we love truffle. My husband is a chef. We weren't sure what grade of truffle we were eating but not on par with the French Laundry. The main dish, a beef roll of sorts was tough and chewy. The desert,  a cherry cheesecake another disappointment. I will give them the chocolate chip cookies and tiny cappuccino cream puff, both delicious. The wine list is outrageously expensive and the choices lacking. I suggest you pay the corkage and bring your own wine. Spending $500 on a dinner for two that looked pretty and listening to an arrogant loud, screaming chef all night....not worth the money in my opinion.|en|https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g32999-d492400-r830518527-Reviews-The_Kitchen_Restaurant-Sacramento_California.html?m=66827#review830518527|457elainev|Family|2022-03-31|2.0

The Pocket Area of Sacramento is a lovely diversified community and A Taste Above is an example of that diversification.  From Asian, Hawaiian, Italian, Portuguese to Philadelphia the small menu has a little bit for everyone, including a vegan menu that includes the popular Impossible Burger (The Beyond Buger) with fries (it can be ordered with a gluten free bun!).  My partner and I both ordered the Impossible Burger, and I had the GF bun. We stuffed ourselves silly on these huge burgers and couldn’t get enough of the delicious fries.  We noticed other customers were saying similar things about their meals.

After a little while out came my brother's ""club"" sandwich on Dutch Crust which he loved.  His garlic fries looked so good I had to try them.  Terrific.  I had heard about the ""A Plate Above"" meal and had to try it.  It came out and to my surprise it actually looked bigger and better than I had expected.  My three items were Kalbi short ribs, Teriyaki beef steak, and deep fried shrimp all serve on a bed of white rice with a side of mac salad.  It was a fantastic meal for only $13.95.  I could only eat half before getting full.  We were checked on at least twice to see if we need anything by a smiling young lady.  Once the boss came out to tell us about the deals they are having for vets on Veterans Day.  He was all smiles too... as were we.

Interesting double-quonset hut shaped building on the outside with a roomy yet sound-damping interior. It even has an English pub-style snug. We've tested it out on a Friday night and it doesn't get too loud even when all the tables are full, which is a wonderful discovery in this city of hard-surfaced, vaulted-ceiling, roaringly loud bars and restaurants. The cocktails are excellent, the food also. A relatively small menu which I approve of: its focused on few but well-chosen and excellently executed items with a range of prices, all reasonable.

It's a small town, there's a gas station in the center of the piazza, and if you're looking for the hotel - well, the sign mostly indicates the restaurant: Ristorante La Vecchia Fonte. In fact, you have to enter the restaurant, walk through to the back, and say you have a reservation in the hotel. The friendly and helpful (though somewhat English-challenged) staff take you upstairs and show you your room - the rooms are bright, clean, and usable, with views overlooking the piazza or the town. It's a 15 minute (or so) level walk to the historic abandoned town of Vertozza nearby; otherwise, there's not much to do in San Quirico. We had dinner in the hotel's restaurant (Very good!) and breakfast (included) in the back of the restaurant. The promised WiFi didn't seem to connect in our room - but this is often the case in Italian hotels in our experience.|en|https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1810165-d1791839-r378336873-Reviews-Albergo_Agnelli-San_Quirico_Sorano_Province_of_Grosseto_Tuscany.html?m=66827#review378336873|875alanz|Couples|2016-04-30|

No one was drunk, we were peacefully enjoying our treats, I hadn’t even drank 20% of my drink.  She may have been going through something personal because when I asked her name, she raised her eyebrows, swung her head, and raised her voice to say, “Would you just like to talk to the manager?!” We accepted the offer, but regardless, will never return. So sad.  When we first arrived and ordered our initial drinks, the patrons that left the seats we took were bragging about drinking a whole bottle of Don Julio 70 between the two of them along with the same bar tender. At that point, the bartender accidentally took our full drinks and dumped them. So we mentioned the error and she supplied replacements. As I said, I didn’t drink mine and my husband finished his by the time of her episode.  The manager explained they had just had some ABC training and they were buckling down. This would be entirely understandable. However, the bar tender’s  judgement was misplaced and targeted. That, in addition to her horrendous decorum, has destroyed the establishment’s rapport with us.|en|https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g33130-d2224396-r884349129-Reviews-Waterloo-Stockton_California.html?m=66827#review884349129|TDiede1|Friends getaway|2023-04-30|2.0

Furikake fries: unusual Japanese spices served with two uncommon sauces, quoth the menu.  Blah.  Flavorless.  Sauces seemed mostly like ketchup with a bit of BBQ sauce and a mayo.  Unconsumable. BUT...the wood oven baked Khachapuri was quite tasty, although it could have used a much bigger dose of garlic and butter.  Again, unusual, with, of all things, a soft egg yolk proudly in the center.  Now, HOW this item appeared on what is a pretty standard fare menu is anyone's guess. The ""Ora"" king salmon was perfectly cooked and served on a plentiful bed of mixed vegetables.  Would be enhanced with some balsamic glaze, and that could be served in a cup on the side. The pineapple crisp dessert was another item that sounded great but whose execution left lots to be desired.   Topped with a rubberized piece of pineapple that could have served well as a drain closure.  Ice cream was OK, but they left the crisp off the crisp.  Oh, well... Pleasant, helpful, and attentive service personnel. Limited and not outrageously priced wine and beer offerings; easy free parking.

So glad we did!  We figured the only way to better understand San Francisco's culinary fine dining history was to trace it right back near the start.  Chef Gary Danko was among the early wave of James Beard Award winning chefs in San Francisco and later became part of the first generation of Michelin-starred chefs in the city once the Michelin Guide began rating San Francisco restaurants.   I've read some Yelp reviews calling his food ""old school"". After our experience there, I'd say it's more of a throwback to the golden age of fine dining. You won't find trendy hyper-local experimental cuisine with designer eatable floral pedals in mini Japanese pottery and expensive foam that pretends to be flavor. Instead you'll find a rolling cheese cart, white tablecloths, impeccable service and sauces that use classic French techniques (béarnaise, fumets, veloutés). All paying homage to classic French cooking.   The menu offers 3, 4, or 5-course prix‑fixe menu with ample choices in each category.  We chose the 3 and 4.   We enjoyed every dish.   Stand Outs:  Roast Lobster with Potato Purée, Edamame, Peas, Asparagus, and Tarragon Jus - Tender lobster, nicely seasoned and comforting potato purée and velvety tarragon jus.  The Glazed Oysters with Osetra Caviar. So good! I could've eaten 3 more. Plump perfectly cooked oysters topped with a generous amount of Osetra caviar nestled in a silky leek fondue and a light lettuce cream. Buttery but not rich and with a wonderful briny ocean finish.   Filet of Beef with Potato Gratin, King Trumpet Mushrooms. Tender and juicy that paired perfectly with the bone marrow béarnaise.   The Horseradish Crusted Salmon: We had questions - how is a ""horseradish"" crust so airy and fluffy? Then we consulted with our server who spilled the beans. It's the Egg Whites folded in with the horseradish.  Add a tangy grain mustard sauce to balance the rich salmon, and you've got an old-school French combo. IMHO, in today's flavor landscape, mustard doesn't get enough love.   Let's talk dessert!!  Pastry Chef Killian Guillotin grew up in Brittany, France, and  cut his teeth in top French kitchens before sharing his magic here.   The Baked Chocolate Soufflé with two sauces. Light as a cloud with just enough rich-sweetness to say dessert's in the house. And don't get me started with the vanilla bean crème anglaise and Belgian chocolate sauces. Worth every calorie!!  Is Gary Danko old school? Maybe. But in the way your favorite vintage wine is old. Complex, full bodies, and full of finesse .   Happy Eating!!"|en|https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g60713-d370412-r1021482826-Reviews-Restaurant_Gary_Danko-San_Francisco_California.html?m=66827#review1021482826|h2oblue|Couples|2025-07-31|

We had the set menu Steak Tartare and Striploin (fatty but to be expected) and Sticky Toffee Pudding. We thoroughly enjoyed the food, there was a nice busy ambience and feel to the restaurant. We were close enough to a window to have a view of the park.  Visiting from England and Abu Dhabi we were celebrating my daughters 21st birthday. Every other place we have been to in New York have acknowledged this and we have loved the welcoming feel. The Bluebird dinner was the real big event for us and we were soo disappointed with the service. We were greeted with a ‘Yes’ I almost wanted to apologise for being there. The maitre d walked away without speaking to us - we kind of figured we should follow! Most restaurants begin with a Good Evening and Welcome at the very least. A waiter asked if we wanted water (we later noticed everyone else having tap water) and swiftly brought a bottle of still. No smile, no niceties, no welcome.  Next our server came to us, perfectly amicable and perfunctory but no introduction or welcome. We ordered our food and drinks.  Food came very quickly as starters were both cold. I asked a waiter if we could have our drinks, he explained they were busy. I explained this was a special occasion and so far it had been less than special. To his credit a few minutes later the drinks appeared. We received our steaks and the manger noted we had no steak knives, which she quickly corrected. Mains cleared and deserts promptly brought out.  When we had finished our desert our server asked if we wanted anything or just the check! By this time I was totally incensed. Let alone feel this was a special occasion, we were now feeling an inconvenience and she just wanted us to leave. 250 dollars for 2 - I at least expect to feel welcome.  Perhaps I am wrong to expect a little more personalised attention at a restaurant of this standard. Clearly it is just a get them in and out and take their money business model. I did not leave a tip and funnily enough no one asked me if everything was ok for me to put my thoughts across at the end of the evening. A shame that such a special occasion will be tainted by a lack of attention and personal experience.|en|https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g60763-d15058185-r863732002-Reviews-Bluebird_London_NYC-New_York_City_New_York.html?m=66827#review863732002|Mama_Five1|Family|2022-10-31|

A few things: - This isn’t a Mexican restaurant. It’s meso-American centered around different types of corn. The head chef and all the kitchen staff are Colombian.  - As expected for a Michelin starred restaurant, it was very inventive and we found almost every dish incredible. The flavors were complex and the presentation was amazing. The only exception was one dish (the catch of the day), which was too salty in our opinion, but that was an outlier of the 8 dishes we tried. The highlights were the tacos al pastor, smoked trumpet mushrooms, crab arepa, and carnitas.  - The service was on point.

Lots of flavor with Mexican roots mixed and combined in a creative way.  A wonderful culinary experience that explains why this gem earned one star Michelin.

The man at the entrance knows nothing to choose the people. Gipsy kind of people are inside the place.  After entering to the restaurant we’ve waited 30+ minutes at the bar for our reserved table to be ready which we reserved a month ago. When we were waiting we ordered cocktail and had the worst cocktail ever! Decoration is nice (only good thing of the restaurant) but the sound system is horrible as you only hear sub frequencies and cannot understand the music + noise of the people inside make it a jungle. Food is worse than average. You can have better chinese and japanese food even on the street.  We ordered a bottle of wine and had just 3 quarter glasses from it and the waiter asked for more wine as he lost the bottle. Then we asked him to find and he found it after we pushed him to!

I was ignored by the first female and was given a puzzled look that they can't be opened. After I went around to seek attention from the other staff she rudely stated both bathrooms are not available, after I asked why she said "" they just are "". I asked to see what would cause them to be unusable but could only feel discriminated as she added no urgency to the issue. She then asked if I was management to even request to see the inside of the bathrooms. As a LONG TIME CUSTOMER. I suggest to keep your client based loyal to address this issue as it leaves a bad image on the franchise. I left feeling ""I didn't have it my way "". And that's just a bowl movement.

I am from the Caribbean &  most restaurants think if you put a fried banana on a plate that will make it Caribbean food...no not true!  The Caribbean is a a melting pot with complex cuisine...Spanish, French, African, Indian, Dutch, Portuguese, influences.  The Breadfruit Tree is Caribbean food.  Louis the owner was so friendly- the food was delicious.  I thought I was ""home"" and my grandmother was in the kitchen. We started with a rum punch...but this wasn't any old rum punch...this was a really West Indian Rum punch...tastes so good but packs a punch!!!  We had the food served family style & we ordered the sweet fish, curry, jerk chicken, peleau...OMG everything was delicious!!!! The menu changes daily so you have to read the chalkboard...I was hoping for Roti...but it wasn't on the chalkboard.  However, Louis did tell me if I call ahead he'd make sure it was on the menu the next time I came by.  Service was good- drinks arrived quickly- food took a little time...but if you go with good company the wait won't matter, because it's worth the wait!!!    They are open seasonally so call ahead if its not boating season...if the weather is good they may be there.  I can hardly wait to go back...I almost forgot save room for desert- the chocolate bread pudding tastes just like my granddad's bread pudding & I only like my granddad's bread pudding...Louis is an amazing chef....and I LOVE his bread pudding!!!

I remember eating at Xochimilco Cafe as a child very fondly and was looking forward to revisiting a very  old friend.  The food was well above-average and the portions were enormous. I ordered the two tostada plate, choosing guacamole and chicken. Both tostadas were built on hot, freshly-made tortillas and were heaped with cheese, lettuce, tomatoes, and sour cream. I enjoyed them very much. Rice, beans and fresh, hot flour tortillas were also served and were delicious.   My companion ordered a three-item combination plate, that, as it came with Chile Verde and Chile Colorado, was really a 5-item plate. It was an absolutely enormous platter of food. While she ate only a small percentage of it, she proclaimed it as delicious.   The dining room hadn't changed very much since 1970, and the downtown Stockton location is far from attractive.  But the food made the trip worthwhile.|en|https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g33130-d2231110-r624030723-Reviews-Xochimilco_Cafe-Stockton_California.html?m=66827#review624030723|592rickh|Friends getaway|2018-09-30|2.0

She also didn’t bring the juice we ordered for our toddler till the end of the meal. Have you ever dealt with a thirsty toddler? Not good. Also, we ordered bottomless mimosas and only got one refill, after asking repeatedly for it. Our glasses were empty most of the meal. Now the food. We ordered eggs Benedict and the eggs were hard boiled, served over stale bread with just a little bit of hollandaise. It was gross.

We ordered an appetizer of loaded tater tots...yes, folks, tater tots...no one thought to bring small plates for us to use, and we were probably lucky to have napkins and utensils.  Salads were delivered at the same time as our entrée's, which is not a big deal, but the table became very crowded and we felt rushed.  My wife's entrée never arrived; we gave the waiter a few minutes before asking him to go find it, and again, it never arrived.  He seemed shocked that we gave up and wanted the item removed from our bill.  The waiter never asked if we wanted a second round of drinks...it's New Year's Eve, and he doesn't think it's a good idea to offer another round of expensive drinks?  He did ask if we wanted dessert, but by that point, we were done with him and Cafeteria 15L.  The waiter was tipped appropriately for the amount of service provided, which was half of our normal tip.

She couldn’t decide among the various choices, so I suggested the two person tasting menu. They created and vegan masterpiece. The variety of flavors was amazing. Some of the offerings were among the best food I have ever had, vegan or otherwise.  This place is a gem and we had one of the best dinner experiences ever! We did not have wine with dinner, so if that is important, check out the wine list ahead of time. Our only complaint was that there was too much food, but that was erased when we enjoyed a nice lunch of left overs the next day. Finally, for those who love meat, as the name suggests, they have many other choices besides vegan. Try this place and I bet it becomes a regular dinner spot for you and your loved ones.|en|https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g32999-d15007087-r904638006-Reviews-Beast_and_Bounty-Sacramento_California.html?m=66827#review904638006|robertrO8111KR|Family|2023-07-31|

I ordered my food online and I arrived after the time it was supposed to be ready. It wasn't ready when I got there and the lady from the bar was running around asking questions. She finally came to me and asked what I had ordered. I showed her my receipt. She left and came back after like 7 more minutes and let me know that it will be like 10 mins until my order was done. I asked if they just started on my order and she said yes. The worse customer service ever. She didn’t try to make up for their wrong doing or anything. She left me sitting at the bar for 20 mins and asked if I wanted a water. Crazy right? I know.. My food comes out and she hands it to me and tells me to have a goodnight… I’m irritated so I’m just like whatever. I’m really appalled at the lack of customer service here. Then I’m at my car sitting and a Asian lady, whose been eating at the bar for most of the night not assisting and just answering questions, came to my car with like 3-4 more people and said the tab wasn’t paid. I said okay, let me pay it but your employee said bye and goodnight so don’t try to make it like it’s my fault. Y’all dropped the ball tonight and the only thing you could do was come to my car disrespectfully about this bill. And I told her that she should be taking money off got the inconvenience but she didn’t want to hear that. She blamed the kitchen. I told her that is not my problem because it’s not.

My alcoholic beverage was watery and I sent it back. general manager RJ ( who refused to give me his real name who was rude) start talking stuff stating every time I come in here it's an issue and the last time I had an issue with the server. Mind you he was the server I complained about before he became general manager because when he was a server he had the same nasty attitude and I complained to his manager at the time and I'm sorry if a server is being rude to me im going to let upper management know that is my right and if my food comes out not good or cold as a PAYING customer I have a right to have them remake it never was rude always respectful. The fact that he stated this false accusation in front of other customers and staff badgering my character (that's defamation of character which my friend I was with recorded this) he made me feel so humiliated, uncomfortable and he embarrassed me! When I asked to speak with the chain of command he refused and stated with a smart gesture and said ""he's the general manager and he's the last of the chain of command and if the owners want to call me they will and that's if the owner feels like calling me"" and he will let them know it's always an issue which is very much false and I feel he's making this up to cover up his wrong doing and to retaliate against me for when I complained on him. Not only did he humiliated me but defamation of character, I will be taken this further more legally. The disrespect and attitude was uncalled for and very unprofessional and I will be taken actions all the way. Mind you I haven't been here in months because I had kidney surgery (life threatening) and was fighting for my life and came out to celebrate life and this how I'm treated. Run back the cameras and you will see how I was treated and how he humiliated me in front  of staff and customers because he wanted to retaliate. By him being a general manager he should of conducted hisself way better and professionally. He is in place to defuse any issues not make them worst and not to be rude or retaliate against me because he was complained on and now taken this personal. He approached my table with the smart remarks and my friend had me asked him again what he said so we can get it on recording and he did."|en|https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g32999-d10542827-r871434384-Reviews-Station_16-Sacramento_California.html?m=66827#review871434384|Terinam89|Friends getaway|2022-12-31|

It's a small town, there's a gas station in the center of the piazza, and if you're looking for the hotel - well, the sign mostly indicates the restaurant: Ristorante La Vecchia Fonte. In fact, you have to enter the restaurant, walk through to the back, and say you have a reservation in the hotel. The friendly and helpful (though somewhat English-challenged) staff take you upstairs and show you your room - the rooms are bright, clean, and usable, with views overlooking the piazza or the town. It's a 15 minute (or so) level walk to the historic abandoned town of Vertozza nearby; otherwise, there's not much to do in San Quirico. We had dinner in the hotel's restaurant (Very good!) and breakfast (included) in the back of the restaurant. The promised WiFi didn't seem to connect in our room - but this is often the case in Italian hotels in our experience.|en|https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1810165-d1791839-r378336873-Reviews-Albergo_Agnelli-San_Quirico_Sorano_Province_of_Grosseto_Tuscany.html?m=66827#review378336873|875alanz|Couples|2016-04-30|

I am a big eater and couldn't finish it all so have enough left for a snack later! A great deal considering the quality, satisfying portions, the best nutrition--not to mention pure enjoyment. The salad garnish with the hummus was so exceptionally tasty and fresh and the portions were generous and the pita was made in this unique sort of delicious almost crackly translucent but still pita-ish way that is not like a dry pita cracker.

So I had their breakfast California burrito, which was excellent. It came with the best pico de gallo I have ever had and also came with a small side of fruit and there was also what looked like Italian dressing, which I didn’t use because the burrito really didn’t need it. This plate  could easily be shared. Also had their freshly squeezed orange juice, delicious.My husband had the fish and chips and he said it was outstanding and the fries were really good. It also came with tartar sauce, an aioli and bbq sauce. This restaurant is a little pricey, but for the quality of food you get it’s worth it.  This place also has a great variety of different types of burgers and an extensive list of craft beers on tap. Such a great restaurant!|en|https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g32999-d9606443-r793671368-Reviews-Meet_Eat-Sacramento_California.html?m=66827#review793671368|Sac2Travelers|NONE|2021-06-30|

Good amenities in a great location.   Perhaps the best part was my experience at breakfast this morning. The standard Holiday Inn Express offerings were very well prepared (e.g., perfectly moist and appealing scrambled eggs) and the attendants distinguished themselves by their continuous checks and attention to detail like wiping up spills. However, the MOST REMARKABLE service I witnessed was when one of the two attendants noticed a guest (walking with a cane) needing assistance as he served his plate from the buffet. She respectfully approached him and offered her help. It was spontaneous kindness and true customer service at its best!  Both my day and my trip were made better by seeing the above (while also enjoying a tasty, filling breakfast)!  I will be back!|en|https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g35805-d114608-r1038633931-Reviews-Holiday_Inn_Express_Chicago_Magnificent_Mile_By_IHG-Chicago_Illinois.html?m=66827#review1038633931|M5576FMscottc|Solo travel|2025-11-30|

I think the pictures make the rooms look bigger than they truly are- they do say it that rooms are small and cozy- it is truly SMALL AND COZY. Small that 2 people can barely walk at the same time. If you are clear on that you will have a fabulous stay- if you skip over that detail (like me) you may be confused. Aside from the small rooms they do offer a nice breakfast.

It is thought it was a caravanserai. While named 'Qasr' (castle) the towers are solid and the slits in the walls unsuitable for arrows but useful for ventilation. I visited as part of a tour group- one of 3 sites visited under the 'Desert Castles' label as half a day trip.  The ride from Amman to the Qasr/s is flat desert and military sites with the occasional camel to spot and the 'castles' are easily spotted from the road. Each has their own point of interest. You can explore the many rooms of the caravanserai, peek out into the desert, imagine the travellers who may have journied here, consider how different the location must have been in less arid days. A lonely location- not something to make a special trip to on its own, but as part of a tour of similar structures it is a nice day out.|en|https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g293986-d655179-r955692723-Reviews-Qasr_Al_Harranah-Amman_Amman_Governorate.html?m=66827#review955692723|FlippertyG|Friends getaway|2024-05-31|

The week flew by as I was having fun and learning a lot.  The Crow Canyon instructors even slightly changed our itinerary because our group had so many questions about the entire process for site, so we had extra lab time to go over the lab processes.

Good amenities in a great location.   Perhaps the best part was my experience at breakfast this morning. The standard Holiday Inn Express offerings were very well prepared (e.g., perfectly moist and appealing scrambled eggs) and the attendants distinguished themselves by their continuous checks and attention to detail like wiping up spills. However, the MOST REMARKABLE service I witnessed was when one of the two attendants noticed a guest (walking with a cane) needing assistance as he served his plate from the buffet. She respectfully approached him and offered her help. It was spontaneous kindness and true customer service at its best!

The range of wines allows a different tasting experience each time we visit.  On this visit, we particularly liked the Sauvignon Blanc, which is not sharp, and the Choreograph, which is a field blend of ten varietals, but the Malbec was among the best wines we've tasted -- and we've tasted in over 200 wineries in eight states.  Occasionally we encounter a wine that evokes an intense pleasurable response, and this Malbec was one of those.  It would be hard to find a better wine at the price, and it would be even harder to find a better wine at twice the price.  Note that the winery is closed on Saturdays for religious observance, but it's worth the effort to fit it into the schedule on another day.|en|https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g32837-d672902-r693417863-Reviews-Herzog_Wine_Cellars-Oxnard_California.html?m=66827#review693417863|bruceh561|Couples|2019-07-31|1.0

The Panorama room on the 1st floor we had was spotless - clean, fairly large with a nice bathroom and large balcony.  The staff is very nice and polite and the owner is both friendly and professional - always available and ready to help. The B&B option is quite convenient because residents are allowed to prepare meals in the kitchen in the afternoon if they don't want to dine outside. The restaurants, bars and shops are within a short walking distance down to the main street.  The wellness area is fairly small but very intimate with Finnish sauna, Turkish Bath and Kneipp pool available.

It is spacious and got a big TV with tables and chairs so it was perfect. I also attended a Chinese New Year festival several years ago there with over 1,000 people in attendance with lots of live entertainment under big tents with proper stage, and lots of vendors.

It is thought it was a caravanserai. While named 'Qasr' (castle) the towers are solid and the slits in the walls unsuitable for arrows but useful for ventilation. I visited as part of a tour group- one of 3 sites visited under the 'Desert Castles' label as half a day trip.  The ride from Amman to the Qasr/s is flat desert and military sites with the occasional camel to spot and the 'castles' are easily spotted from the road. Each has their own point of interest. You can explore the many rooms of the caravanserai, peek out into the desert, imagine the travellers who may have journied here, consider how different the location must have been in less arid days. A lonely location- not something to make a special trip to on its own, but as part of a tour of similar structures it is a nice day out.|en|https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g293986-d655179-r955692723-Reviews-Qasr_Al_Harranah-Amman_Amman_Governorate.html?m=66827#review955692723|FlippertyG|Friends getaway|2024-05-31|

The week flew by as I was having fun and learning a lot.  The Crow Canyon instructors even slightly changed our itinerary because our group had so many questions about the entire process for site, so we had extra lab time to go over the lab processes.

My husband and I had the steak tartare - truthfully, we've had better, but this was good.

Get better!|It was the coldest night in the year so far for 2025 and they had all the doors open when we got there and we asked if we could be seated four out of our nine people were present. The restaurant was empty the major D told us that we could not see while the bartender and another person told us that we could I asked to speak to manager Nori. She’s the most unprofessional person and was very rude to the maître D and to myself when she came out front and explicitly told us no, in a very rude fashion. She chastise her employees in front of customers, which is very inappropriate. Within five minutes we were shown to our table which I found to be very confusing after she made such a harp on the fact that it was Policy that that could not happen. I ordered the short ribs and found aluminum foil in the middle of my meal and was explained to me by my waiter Dino that that’s common because they wrapped them in aluminum foil when they’re cooked. My son got two doubles of Jamison and was charged $150 plus an additional $48 charge called neat and well. Because he ordered them without ice he asked the waiter to explain it to him. He could not the manager came out. He had a beard never knew his name, but after arguing the same thing as the waiter he eventually took the additional $48 off .

We've been to Ola many times before, starting in 2012 (see my previous reviews), and for many years it was our favorite South Beach restaurant. They've moved twice in that time, and this was our first visit to their current location at the Gates Hotel. Our last visit was 5 years ago. While the food and service is still very good, the overall experience is not what it used to be.  Ola is the hotel restaurant for the Gates Hotel. The new space is much smaller and more casual than the previous one, more of a lounge setting, without any of the ambience of the previous locations. I tried to make an online reservation via Ola's website, but it showed no availability so I contacted them directly. When we arrived around 7pm, the restaurant was mostly empty, and it remained that way during our entire meal. The only visible staff were our server, the bartender, and a couple of buspeople, who all provided very good service. It was a bit warm out, so we sat inside.  The Ola website doesn't have their menu online, but I found one on the Gates Hotel website. The online menu is very similar to the one we remember, but the actual menu was much more limited. Many of our favorite dishes, including the empanadas and smoked fish tacos, are no longer available. They still have their tasty Colombian rolls, but they now charge $3 each.  We both had Caipirinhas, which were very good. We started by sharing the Hamachi Nikkei Ceviche, which we've had before, and it was a tasty as we remember. For dinner, my wife had the fish of the day, branzino, and I had the Roast Cuban Pork, which I've had before. Both dishes were very good. We also each had a Colombian roll, which were as good as ever. We didn't have dessert.  The prices were on the high side, but typical for the area. Like most South Beach restaurants, Ola adds a 20% service charge to the menu.  While the food is still very good, there are many great restaurants in the area to choose from, so I don't know if we'll return to Ola, given the limited menu and lack of ambience.|en|https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g34439-d501579-r942375354-Reviews-OLA_Restaurant-Miami_Beach_Florida.html?m=66827#review942375354|DeeEss|Couples|2024-03-31|1.0

We walked in and were welcomed, escorted to our table and given a drinks and sushi menu. Soaking in the atmosphere you cannot help but notice a quantifying array of pitchforks. I asked a server how many they were but that will remain a mystery.   We then met Caesar- a brilliant server for relaxed fine dining, clearly knowing his role inside out. I would describe him as attentive, cheerful, upbeat, helpful, and incredibly on the ball which led us feeling extremely relaxed and excited for the evening ahead. He initially let us get settled, and once we had chosen the wine he suggested some food.   The wine we went for was a Sauvignon blanc 2022, in the Grgich Hills of Napa Valley, costing us $85, after checking vivino, it was only marked up $20.   We also had complimentary bottled spring water from Tuscany.   To start with we had octopus, tuna tartar, and the wagyu and pork meatballs.  The octopus had been charred, accompanied with delicious sweet tomatoes and potatoes. As someone who doesn’t like seafood and has tried octopus before and haven’t been keen, I would’ve finished the plate.  The tartar was flavoursome, beautiful, and fresh. The corn chips were salty to balance the flavour.  The meatballs were the best meatballs I have ever eaten. The meat was incredibly tender and soft, and seasoned perfectly with herbs. The tomato sauce rich and deep in flavour. .   We chatted and admired the kitchen, had are drinks topped up whilst waiting for our mains. Our glasses were never empty. Our servers were extremely attentive.   They arrived, we both ordered the signature Wellington, with the potato puree, brussel sprouts and macaroni and cheese.   The presentation of the Wellington was simple yet elegant. I just stared for a minute not knowing how to tackle it.  I picked up my knife, pressed it lightly onto the Wellington and my jaw dropped in disbelief. The tenderness of the beef was just wow. I softly cut into my wellington with a smile on my face. I only managed half because of the richness, but that’s my problem, not the wellingtons.  On the drive back I ate the other half like a pork pie and it was equally magnificent.   Sprouts were very rich and crunchy, I couldn’t have sat there and smashed through a bowl of it.  The mac and cheese was slightly underwhelming. It wasn’t ’knock your socks off that’s good Mac and cheese.’ The potato puree was creamy, elegant and yum.   The stars of the show were the Wellington and the starters.  Caesar kindly took an anniversary picture of us, gave us the bill ensuring there is no rush to leave.   We left just before 10 after an amazing 2 hour dining experience, and had a walk in the local area - a lovely part of downtown Miami.|en|https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g34438-d26637643-r1036938060-Reviews-Gordon_Ramsay_Hell_s_Kitchen-Miami_Florida.html?m=66827#review1036938060|Seaside47592894237|Couples|2025-10-31|

From Venice to London NY and Miami.  The bar tender is clueless.  My husband asked for a glass of Amaroni, he replied he didnt have a glass of that particular wine.  So, he suggested, ""Price Blind"" Super Tuscan he had behind the bar.  My husand said yes, the waiter took our glass of wine to the table, still have NO idea how much the glass of wine was assuming under $40.  He orders 2/3 more glasses of the same wine..we get the bill and the 6 OZ crappy pour was $90 dollars a glass!!!!! The bar tendar is a clueless piece of crap, who should have suggested a bottle of wine at the bar in lieu of a $90 half 6oz glass of wine.    Be aware at this bar, the bar tender and managmenet are a bunch of clueless, unaware  pigs.   The manager on duty, Marco was kind enough to give us the credit for each $90 glass back on our Amex, we declined the offer.   That isnt the piont.

While it wasn't the birthday party's fault, I think the party should have been held somewhere away from regular diners. They were loud and celebrating which was expected but again why have a party of 30 ppl in the center of a restaurant? After the party, the clean up consists of hitting the pillows loudly, moving furniture, and carrying long wooden tables over the heads of diners while we ate- (extremely dangerous) The food was subpar, (ordered the curry shrimp, salmon was the end of the fish with brown parts under, ravioli was like 12 pieces, the side (spicy yellow rice was hard). The food was not to Cipirani standards NYC or Dubai location. The view-  obstructed by plastic wrapped windows and no seating in a the patio space. The restaurant was cramped, tiny tables, low back chairs. I think the restaurant could have so much potential. Go to Casa Tua in Brickell for better Italian food and bypass this Cipirani. This location should be closed.|en|https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g34438-d4339322-r1019654991-Reviews-Cipriani_Downtown_Miami-Miami_Florida.html?m=66827#review1019654991|misssophiatraveler|Family|2025-07-31|

You can clearly see Massimo Bottura’s influence in the innovative approach to traditional Italian flavors.  The portions are a bit small, which might leave some wanting more, but the attention to detail in every bite makes up for it.  The neighborhood is rough and still developing—it feels unsafe at night. Hopefully, things will improve soon.  One suggestion: the staff should speak more Italian. Some try, but it’s minimal. A stronger Italian presence would enhance the authenticity of the experience.

At checkout our grand total for the weekend was $158.00 .  I did NOT notice ANY smell in the hallway or the rooms as a matter of fact when we were leaving which we were late checking out and he never said a word about it all the rooms were being cleaned , aired and linens and towels being changed.

Gorgeous old homes and buildings!  Amazing!!!    The service was very good and we loved that it is a tip free restaurant.  Awesome that they provide a great work environment for their employees.    The portions were huge!  Especially the pork chops!!!!  Also the cheese from the selection of 3 cheeses appetizers,  2 of the 3 were huge chunks of cheese.    Most of our food was amazing and very delicious.  But my sister and I had the PEI mussels that were very off and made me almost throw up.  We couldn’t eat them.  We told our waiter at the end of our meal, as he asked how the food was.  He told the cook and the cook said they were fresh, bought that day and tasted fine.  Too bad for us!  Charged full price .  Not that we were expecting them to remove the charge but since neither of us could eat them we would have thought there would have been more than a “too bad!”  It left our experience less that delightful.|en|https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g60713-d368755-r1011017810-Reviews-Zazie-San_Francisco_California.html?m=66827#review1011017810|175debbiev|Family|2025-06-30|1.0

First of all the neon lighting sign was out. As we entered the hotel reception we were greeted by what seemed to be a very miserable hotel manager. After a lot of faffing about with a man that could only speak very little English we finally got to our room. As we arrived late there was some 'fresh food' bought up to us. This wasn't fresh and it seemed to stay in our room for 3 days after we arrived. We decided to have a drink in the bar which I'm pretty sure is a makeshift bar with the bar staff not being able to speak English to the point where we had to pour our own drinks. I won't ramble on to much about how awful this hotel is, but the restaurant was filthy, the rooms were unclean, the pool side was horrendous with empty cups laying everywhere so it was heaven for the flies.  The restaurant which does seem to cater for the Russian guests. We did complain to our rep. The manager offered us an alcarte menu which still would be prepared in the same kitchen which we did ask to view before hand and was very quickly dismissed.

Baker|When I think about the term “fusion” as applied to restaurants, it often strikes me that it is misused, misunderstood, or both.  What passes for fusion in many restaurants is having more than one cuisine represented on the menu.  To me, true fusion is achieved only by combining more than one cuisine or technique in a single dish.  In the Seattle area, no restaurant accomplishes that better or more consistently than Iconiq.  Chef Toshiyuki Kawai, born in Osaka, Japan, and trained in French techniques in the kitchens of the late great Thierry Rautureau (among others), prepares what at first glance appears to be French food.  However, after sampling his food, it quickly becomes clear that there are subtle Japanese influences in almost every dish.  My most recent meal at Iconiq demonstrated this very well.  I had just 3 courses and a glass of wine.  My first course was cured salmon over a bed of white asparagus mousse.  The mousse was delicious, with a firm, pudding-like consistency, and it complemented the salmon beautifully.  My main was locally caught Neah Bay black cod, grilled exactly right so as to crisp the skin and provide a white flesh that was firm enough not to be gelatinous (an issue sometimes with cod) without overcooking.  The cod was served over wonderful white beans and other vegetables, some of which appeared to be pickled but lightly so, as well as fingerling potatoes and a tomato-yuzu broth.  Delicious!  For dessert, I had a scoop of soy sauce ice cream, accompanied by candied walnuts and compressed Fuji apples.  I have to admit that sounds a bit weird but I have come to trust Chef Kawai and he recommended that I try it.  I am very glad I did.  It was a delightful combination of flavors and textures and very refreshing.  In addition to providing some of the most creative and delicious food in town, Iconiq’s position on the west side of the Mt. Baker Ridge affords the restaurant some very nice views of the Rainier Valley, the downtown skyline, and even a piece of Elliott Bay.  The place is gourmet and high-end but always warm and inviting and never stuffy.  I highly recommend Iconiq.|en|https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g60878-d16875026-r950606915-Reviews-Iconiq-Seattle_Washington.html?m=66827#review950606915|SteveLikes_3_Stars|Solo travel|2024-04-30|

I was surprised that the chef both attended front of house and the (open) kitchen. The food and wine were delicious. The octopus was tender and perfectly seasoned. The fish main was perfectly cooked, although I felt the endives were a little too bitter. Dessert was light and refreshing. Food choices are a bit limited, but everything tried was really good. Service was friendly and attentive. So why 4/5? I think some kinks still need to be worked out. It would make sense to hire at least one waitstaff to better tend to the customers.

I ordered the red pepper soup…it was delicious with just the right amount of kick. Table service included a chewy baguette with butter. We treated ourselves to the chocolate mousse for dessert-WOW!  Velvety dark chocolate mousse served along side a portion of perfectly whipped heavy cream. A single order is large enough to serve 2-4. Great wines to choose from. This is a great break in the day for a delicious meal.|en|https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g60878-d432613-r1025191082-Reviews-Le_Pichet-Seattle_Washington.html?m=66827#review1025191082|kendellbrink|Couples|2025-08-31|

I|Le Pichet has such a warm, charming atmosphere, it feels very cozy and cute, the kind of place that makes you want to linger. The rotisserie chicken was outstanding: moist, flavorful, and one of the best I’ve had.  What took away from the experience, unfortunately, was the service. The server wasn’t friendly, and I believe the owners (an older gentleman and a lady with glasses and bold red lipstick) came across the same way. While we were still enjoying dessert and a digestif, we were given the bill early because there were people waiting for a table. To be clear, this wasn’t a case of us occupying a table without ordering, we had spent over $200 for two people that evening. We sat down at 7pm and we already got the check (without us asking) at 8.30pm..  Overall, while the food is delicious and the venue itself is lovely, the hospitality left a lot to be desired. I wouldn’t recommend Le Pichet unless you don’t mind indifferent service.|en|https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g60878-d432613-r1024811919-Reviews-Le_Pichet-Seattle_Washington.html?m=66827#review1024811919|179cliffordy|Friends getaway|2025-08-31|

My friend and I so enjoyed our dinner at Le Pichet. We are vegetarians:  We had a mushroom crepe, an asparagus salad, and the seasonal dessert and were very happy.  The staff was very busy and very helpful. Because the cafe is very small, the diners sit very close to each other which makes it almost impossible to NOT have conversations with the next table.

Nonetheless, we would expect the same high quality offerings on every menu. The dining experience, even for Seattle which has become overrated, was indeed excellent but not a cheap date. The fixed menu at $175 per person became substantially more costly after adding the recommended sake pairings.

The food was fabulous!  Every plate felt like a piece of art. Chef, and his team, was friendly and polite, as you would expect from a Japanese restaurant. We shared a Saki tasting, which was plenty for the two of us, and we loved the beautiful saki cups. Each one was so unique. Our only criticism is that the meal felt really rushed. We were seated at 8pm, served 10 courses and were done by 9.30!  We sat at the chef’s counter, and everyone was served each dish at the same time, so it wasn’t just that we were eating fast. It was an expensive evening, so I would have liked to linger.

Service was attentive and each course as well as the paired sakes were explained. If Seattle had Michelin stars, this restaurant would be on their list.   We were lucky to sit at the counter and were able to watch as dishes were prepared. There were eight courses that were paced well over about two hours. For me, the highlights included Copper River salmon sashimi, wagyu that melted in your mouth, grilled eel, and tuna nigiri, but each course was fantastic. The chef and other staff spoke to us about the provenance of the food as well as providing stories/history on why we were eating certain items.

This course meal progresses with sashimi and other types of seafood. A5 Wagyu is featured twice.  The white miso ozoni was very good and in middle courses, the Chef serves a sampler of pressed sushi and aged tuna nigiri.

I wasn't sure what to expect with the site survey program, but it was a great learning experience as the first part of the archeological process.  The week flew by as I was having fun and learning a lot.  The Crow Canyon instructors even slightly changed our itinerary because our group had so many questions about the entire process for site, so we had extra lab time to go over the lab processes.

I ordered my food online and I arrived after the time it was supposed to be ready. It wasn't ready when I got there and the lady from the bar was running around asking questions. She finally came to me and asked what I had ordered. I showed her my receipt. She left and came back after like 7 more minutes and let me know that it will be like 10 mins until my order was done. I asked if they just started on my order and she said yes. The worse customer service ever. She didn’t try to make up for their wrong doing or anything. She left me sitting at the bar for 20 mins and asked if I wanted a water. Crazy right? I know.. My food comes out and she hands it to me and tells me to have a goodnight… I’m irritated so I’m just like whatever. I’m really appalled at the lack of customer service here. Then I’m at my car sitting and a Asian lady, whose been eating at the bar for most of the night not assisting and just answering questions, came to my car with like 3-4 more people and said the tab wasn’t paid. I said okay, let me pay it but your employee said bye and goodnight so don’t try to make it like it’s my fault. Y’all dropped the ball tonight and the only thing you could do was come to my car disrespectfully about this bill. And I told her that she should be taking money off got the inconvenience but she didn’t want to hear that. She blamed the kitchen. I told her that is not my problem because it’s not.

My alcoholic beverage was watery and I sent it back. general manager RJ ( who refused to give me his real name who was rude) start talking stuff stating every time I come in here it's an issue and the last time I had an issue with the server. Mind you he was the server I complained about before he became general manager because when he was a server he had the same nasty attitude and I complained to his manager at the time and I'm sorry if a server is being rude to me im going to let upper management know that is my right and if my food comes out not good or cold as a PAYING customer I have a right to have them remake it never was rude always respectful. The fact that he stated this false accusation in front of other customers and staff badgering my character (that's defamation of character which my friend I was with recorded this) he made me feel so humiliated, uncomfortable and he embarrassed me! When I asked to speak with the chain of command he refused and stated with a smart gesture and said ""he's the general manager and he's the last of the chain of command and if the owners want to call me they will and that's if the owner feels like calling me"" and he will let them know it's always an issue which is very much false and I feel he's making this up to cover up his wrong doing and to retaliate against me for when I complained on him. Not only did he humiliated me but defamation of character, I will be taken this further more legally. The disrespect and attitude was uncalled for and very unprofessional and I will be taken actions all the way. Mind you I haven't been here in months because I had kidney surgery (life threatening) and was fighting for my life and came out to celebrate life and this how I'm treated. Run back the cameras and you will see how I was treated and how he humiliated me in front  of staff and customers because he wanted to retaliate. By him being a general manager he should of conducted hisself way better and professionally. He is in place to defuse any issues not make them worst and not to be rude or retaliate against me because he was complained on and now taken this personal. He approached my table with the smart remarks and my friend had me asked him again what he said so we can get it on recording and he did."|en|https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g32999-d10542827-r871434384-Reviews-Station_16-Sacramento_California.html?m=66827#review871434384|Terinam89|Friends getaway|2022-12-31|

It says it's a 4.5 star hotel offering a pool and sauna, but guess what they tried to charge me 28 euros to use the pool! I only spent 2 nights and I was mostly exploring the area during the day, so the day I checked out I wanted to use the amenities before flying out. Check out is 10:30am, I checked out of my room earlier so cleaning could have a hesd start. Little did I know, I was no longer considered a guest and couldn't use the gym. They argued with me that the pool is not included, yet as you can see from the photo, it's part of the main amenities. I understand paying for massages etc, but access to the hotel pool. This is a first for me and I travel all over Italy half of the year.

The food itself was delicious, but when I got home and looked over my receipt, I realized I was charged for two meals instead of one for several items. I double-checked to make sure it wasn't something I ordered by mistake--it definitely wasn't.  I am not sure how this is even possible since only one item of each was delivered to our table.  Is it a scam???  The total amount overcharged was $109.   I tried calling and emailing the restaurant to sort it out, but haven't been able to get a response yet. Mistakes happen, but overcharging a customer and not fixing it right away doesn't leave a good impression.   Please double-check your bill before you leave!  I hope management sees this and reaches out so this can be corrected.

I believe this was our third or fourth time dining there. I had the Roasted Chicken with Gnocchi and my wife had the Handmade Ricotta Ravioli. To say they were both good would be an understatement. My wife usually never finishes her entree (she did), and it was the absolute best chicken I have ever eaten (anywhere). The only thing that would have made it any better would have been a nice piece of crusty bread to lap up the sauce, as licking the plate would have probably been in bad taste!

Two years ago, we were blown away--not just by the incredible food but also by the warmth of the experience, with Executive Sous Chef at that time, Joe Howard, personally bringing out a few dishes he was working on. The sheer amount of food, the flavors, and the hospitality made it one of the most memorable dining experiences of our lives. Naturally, we knew it would be hard to recreate that magic, but we were eager to try. Securing a reservation is no easy feat, but we managed, and while the experience wasn't bad by any means, a few things dampened the excitement. The biggest disappointment was our seating. Instead of being in the vibrant main dining room--where you can see the kitchen in action, the bar buzzing, and the laffa bread being made--we were placed in a separate room on the outskirts. Unfortunately, this space lacked the energy and charm that makes Zahav so special; it felt more like a standard cafeteria, stripping away a big part of what makes the restaurant's atmosphere so unique. The menu had also changed, and we opted for the Tayim menu. While everything was good, it lacked the ""wow"" factor we had experienced before. In some cases, the descriptions of the dishes were more impressive than the actual flavors. Additionally, while our first visit left us completely full, this time, the meal felt smaller. To be clear, the service was great--attentive, professional, and even including an extra salmon tartar and lovely extra dessert for our birthday. There was no particular fault in any one aspect, but together, the little things added up, making this visit fall short of our high expectations. That said, we're still giving five stars, with the hope that Zahav will return to the unforgettable experience it once was."|en|https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g60795-d1070950-r997325714-Reviews-Zahav-Philadelphia_Pennsylvania.html?m=66827#review997325714|MarishaLevsh|Couples|2025-03-31|

Instead of complimentary flavorings and seasonings, each dish tasted like a jumble of mess. For example my escargot was in a sauce that totally hid the flavor of the snails and even the small surprise of sweet bread cubes was barely noticeable. My rib eye sauce completely hid the meat and even the four small but lovely sweetened carrots and the mushrooms were tasteless. The deserts were a mix of flavors that did nothing for each other. Even their popcorn cheese cake which sounded great was little more than a deconstructed mess. Not a single dish highlighted its main ingredient from the rib eye to rabbit to scallops to halibut. The additions subtracted and there were no clean flavors to be found anywhere.  Now we were a party of 6 and that means service will be a little slow, but it was more than a little slow and getting 5 of the 6 appetizers at once, but waiting 17 minutes for the 6th was inexcusable. It should have been comped. Everyone else was already done as my daughter-in-law insisted we not wait.  When you're spending close to $600 for dinner the servers should know who gets what, but they didn't, although at least for the main course, all came out at the same time.  Finally, they knew we were there for a birthday, but other than the server saying happy birthday nothing was forthcoming, not even a single candle on one of the desserts we all shared.  I couldn't possibly recommend the restaurant to anyone.|en|https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g60795-d18500945-r1022308423-Reviews-Forsythia-Philadelphia_Pennsylvania.html?m=66827#review1022308423|NSL14|Family|2025-08-31|

Some might say the chef was expressing subtle flavors and letting the seafood speak for itself, but my wife and I (both self-confessed ""foodies""), found everything very bland.

We figured that the parking would be more ample in Northern liberties and we would try out the new digs.    First the good news, we were seated right away and the food was very good. That is the end of the good news.  Now for why I do not recommend going here.  The acoustics inside of the restaurant were terrible and it was very hard to hold a conversation without yelling. When placing the order we were informed that vegetables and rice and other accompaniments, which come with a standard platter at the Original location, are all sold separately here.  The food then was brought out and was on all different size plates, none of which made sense given the higher cost.  If sold separately here why would the portions be smaller?  The food was very good, like the original location, but we will not return based on how they’ve decided to set their menu, the smaller portions and the loud interior.  To me it’s also a matter of principle that if there are two restaurants by the same name located within 3 miles of one another that. they should have the same menu or it should be indicated that it is a different concept.  This left a bad taste in my mouth.|en|https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g60795-d4368369-r602687145-Reviews-Dmitri_s-Philadelphia_Pennsylvania.html?m=66827#review602687145|my4sparks|NONE|2018-08-31|

I dined here with my girlfriend for our anniversary and it was a mixed experience for sure.  Pros: the food and service (by Katie) were 5-star as both were excellent, some of the best tapas I've ever had. The entire 5-course meal was excellent.  Cons: 1) If you're going to order the 5-course or chef's tasting menu DO NOT make a later reservation. We came in at 8:30, ordered the 5-course option and by our 2nd course we were the only table left and the staff was cleaning up around us making us feel very uncomfortable, like we were holding them up from closing. 2) Review your bill VERY carefully because there will be odd charges on it. First off, we were charged $70 for a bottle of wine listed for $65 on the menu. Secondly, we were charged a $13 ""beverage tax"" on the alcohol. When I said to the manager, ""so between the sales tax and the beverage tax, you're taxing us twice on the alcohol, right?"" He replied ""yes"". The Phila. beverage tax is intended to sweetened drinks like soda, energy drinks, etc. and is NOT intended for alcohol. We dine in Phila all the time and we've NEVER been charged such a silly charge. We were also charged $8 for using a credit card (which was already on the bill before we even paid). What if we paid with cash? When I told the manager that it's illegal to charge a fee for using a debit card and showed him proof on my phone, he merely looked at me. So we basically paid an extra $25 for nonsense after dropping $250 there.   Will we go back? No we won't. As I said the meal and service were fantastic but feeling rushed when you've ordered a multi-course meal and then being nickel-and-dimed with illegal charges basically ruined an excellent meal and our anniversary dinner. This is especially disappointing given that this is a Townsend Wentz restaurant."|en|https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g60795-d13275000-r988775484-Reviews-Oloroso-Philadelphia_Pennsylvania.html?m=66827#review988775484|L8945JQdavidd|Couples|2025-01-31|

If you make an 8:30 reservation DO NOT choose the 5 course option or chefs choice. You will not have time to fully enjoy the experience.  We weren't even at desert when the place was empty and everyone was cleaning up around us and the bartender left. The music got louder and we were told that if we were uncomfortable we could wrap up the final courses to go. If at the end you still plan going. Keep your choices Ala carte and not so many. 2. We get the bill. Now like most trusting people who aren't expecting to get ripped off we would have just paid but because our server forgot to add our bottle of wine (no problem, these things happen) I decided to look at the check to make sure the rest was right. First thing I see is the beverage tax. In Philly the beverage tax is applied to sweet drinks and energy drinks NOT alcoholic drinks. We did not have what the tax is intended for. We were also charged an $8 credit card fee. With this one-how did they know I'd use a charge card? What if I paid with cash. That aside I did use a DEBIT card. A debit card is the same as cash and cannot be charged a fee. We even googled these things when speaking to the manager to say hey, we're not making this up! When you say to a manager ""you're taxing us twice for the bottle of wine?"" and he says ""YES"", there's a problem.  He even removed the beverage tax. (The manager was great and unless the owner would prefer he lied and look stupid,  he did his job) at this point I wasn't going to argue the credit card charge, though he was aware that it was wrong, these people don't make the big money and wanted to go home. This is a Townsend Wentz restaurant. We have eaten at Townsend as well as Amano. We couldn't recall if these charges were applied there in the underhanded way they were applied here but again, we're people who trust and don't expect to get ripped off. I'm thinking the owners are putting their bets on that. Honestly, of the many, many restaurants we have dined at in Philly, this was a first. My son-in-law is a chef and restaurant owner. He'd never risk his reputation by putting a beverage tax on alcohol served or charge the customer $8 for the use of a debit card (let alone put it on the bill before knowing how the customer is paying).  Yes, the food and service was fantastic, so if you're ok with $25 in taxes-the majority of which should NOT be charged-and the knowledge you're being taken advantage of...Townsend Wentz will give you that."|en|https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g60795-d13275000-r988684316-Reviews-Oloroso-Philadelphia_Pennsylvania.html?m=66827#review988684316|M2156GYnancye|Family|2025-01-31|

Food was good enough, but I especially liked the skillet mac and cheese and the cornbread. Went back on Tuesday expecting at least the same quality or better. Sadly, I was highly disappointed. The greens mixed with cabbage was watery, mushy, and flavorless. The yams were watery, the catfish was flavorless and didn’t seem like fresh fish. I’m thinking it was bagged. And the star of my first visit, the mac and cheese was dried out and flavorless! I will say the turkey wings were AMAZING!   Another thing worth mentioning is the 18% gratuity was charged without our knowledge. There was only two of us and the bill was $65, so adding gratuity wasn’t standard. When I asked the server about this, she informed us that it’s automatically added on certain nights.    After this experience with the food I probably won’t be back|en|https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g60795-d433575-r744842401-Reviews-Warmdaddy_s-Philadelphia_Pennsylvania.html?m=66827#review744842401|Cee_Wanderlust|Couples|2020-02-29|3.0

So when it came time to plan my hubby’s 50th with friends and family, I thought this would be a great venue.    The planning with the coordinator/contracts person was ok. I found that I had to reach out quite a bit as opposed to the other way around.  However, it all came together very nicely.  They allow you to decorate your tables, with some exceptions. The pre-selected food menus to choose from were great as well as the drink packages.  The costs were pretty much as expected and reasonable for 18 people.  There is the entertainment charge for the live band which is a separate cost. And although the coordinator/contracts person wasn’t very personable in person, the contract was ok and she was a pleasure over the phone.   The food was really, really good. My pre-selected menu of choice included an appetizer/starter of Cajun Catfish Fingers, Gumbo Ya Ya, or Country Caesar Salad (although it appears that we ended up with Garden salad instead as our salads didn’t have the homemade cornbread crouton that I had heard so much about).  Our main dish choices were Southern Fried Chicken, Bar-B-Q Atlantic Salmon, or Braised Beef Short Rib with mashed potatoes and Smoked Turkey Collard Greens + Cabbage.  The dessert of choice was the Caramelized Pineapple Bread Pudding (absolutely sinful 😊). We all really enjoyed the meal so much so that we had attendees order extra dishes from the regular menu to take home.   The live band was enjoyable.  We all got to groove to some of that good, soulful music.  Not the music from today, but the music that has stood the test of time and generations.   All in all, it was a great and most memorable celebration and I’m sure hubby and I will return.   Note:  Warmdaddy’s could use some updated table and chairs, however. The tables are showing quite a bit of wear and some are uneven.  If I didn’t decorate the table tops, it would have been really dull and a little unsightly.  I know they are bringing in the “dough” so spend a little and update the decor.|en|https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g60795-d433575-r678751572-Reviews-Warmdaddy_s-Philadelphia_Pennsylvania.html?m=66827#review678751572|TheAdventures|Friends getaway|2019-06-30|2.0

We live nearby but have never been.  We made a res for 1:45 (late for brunch). The place was 1/2 empty but we were seated at a table for 2 at a banquette squeezed between 2 noisy groups and very close to the front door which brought in icy air.  I looked at a long expanse of empty tables and asked if we could sit over there and was told no; they were expecting a big party.  Note:  the big party arrived one hour later when we were ready to leave.  Also 2 other couples arrived and were seated in the forbidden zone. Okay that was #1.  Then no wait person showed up for a longish period of time: #2: no water; no welcome.  Menu was okay.  We both ordered a different version of a salad with grilled salmon. Mine included a poached egg. #3 poached egg arrived hard boiled. I asked for a replacement t and they did bring me a softly poached, runny egg.  We waited a ridiculous amount of time for someone to refill our iced tea. #4: food was mediocre.  Edible but no where near the quality anticipated based on the prices.  I do not recommend this place and would not go back.  Plenty of far better places a short walk away.|en|https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g60795-d24006786-r982871934-Reviews-Wilder-Philadelphia_Pennsylvania.html?m=66827#review982871934|susansR8341FV|Couples|2024-12-31|

This fancy speakeasy has no name on the door, just a gold plaque with a rose on it. You have to ring the doorbell when you arrive and a secret panel opens in the door for the host to speak through. I found it on a list of “cozy and romantic” restaurants with great reviews. It is very dark, with bookshelves, and mismatched vintage plates (which fit the décor I guess, but I would have expected something more minimal.   It is very popular and by the time we made a reservation (on a Thursday night), the only available time was 8:45pm. This was already late for our preference, but we thought we’d try it since everyone raved about it. We arrived early at 8:30pm to see if our table was ready. They said it was not, and the people currently seated had just ordered dessert. They recommended we get a drink nearby and they would text us when the table was ready. We waited at our hotel lobby around the corner, thinking it wouldn’t be that long. We received a text at 9:06pm that said “Your table is now ready at Alpen Rose!” When we arrived a few minutes later, we rang the bell again, only for them to tell us it was still NOT ready. There was a rowdy party of 5 guys also at the door that were taken in before us.   It was almost 9:30pm by the time we were seated. Starving, we ordered oysters Rockefeller. Being so late we asked if we could put in our entrée orders but was told that “the chef likes to course it out”. We were surprised by (who we assumed was) a manager bringing us a complimentary appetizer of tuna carpaccio, however I do not eat raw fish. She left with it and came back to ask if we would like shrimp cocktail instead (which my husband is allergic to). We imagine they were trying to make up for being late, but never asked our preference. She finally brought out a wedge salad, like it or not (which was good, even though I don’t eat bacon).   It was very noisy and we were right on top of the people on either side of us – not romantic at all (the space is very small, seating maybe 40 people). The only good thing were the drinks (we had No. 3 and 21). Vegetables and starch sides do not come with the main dish, you must buy them separately (the asparagus was large but tender and tasty). I ordered the branzino, which she said would have some bones but were large and in almost every bite. We were shocked that my husband’s $56 filet was so tough it was hard to cut! Two small dessert bites showed up at the end of the meal, but they did not make up for the poor performance at this price point.   We were seated next to the noisy guys who came before us, so in the end we tried to make the best of it, joking and trading photos with them and being entertained by their drinks covered with smoke, massive Tomahawk cavemen bone steaks, and flaming baked Alaska with a sparkler. Maybe at 50 we are older than the typical crowd, and now we know not to make a reservation that late (especially when the times are not honored), but a pricey establishment like this should know better how to space out their reservations. I would not recommend this restaurant to anyone, even given the hype.|en|https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g60795-d17393600-r1009031490-Reviews-Alpen_Rose-Philadelphia_Pennsylvania.html?m=66827#review1009031490|jennifersU6289CV|Couples|2025-05-31|2.0

Dry aged is the house specialty and they didn’t get it right. I ordered the dry aged rib eye medium rare. First time out, the meat was a true medium. With appropriate apologies, they cooked another. This came out a true medium rare. However, there was so much char on the meat, I could not taste the subtle taste of a $78 piece of meat. Okay, not happy, but we wouldn’t come back. We were offered a free dessert. Now, at the table adjacent to us, the couple ordered a filet medium rare. Theirs too came out grey. And, like ours, the char was so heavy they said it over-powered the taste of the meat. Finally, our complimentary dessert. It’s prime peach time and they had warm peach pie with ice cream. It had a huge puff pastry crust that had no flavor. And worse, the peach cubes were cold, hard and tasteless. In the middle of peach season. Top all this off with tables so close together that when the server was pouring our neighbors wine, their ass was right in my face. Literally, right there. The only redeeming feature was the cocktails and whisky list. This was our third try of restaurants in this chain. Thy Mary and Pearl Oyster House was okay, but The Oyster House is much better. The Giusseppe restaurant was average; Villa Di Roma is a better choice. And Barkley Prime far outshines Alpen Rose.|en|https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g60795-d17393600-r966764427-Reviews-Alpen_Rose-Philadelphia_Pennsylvania.html?m=66827#review966764427|I6060NTrobs|Couples|2024-08-31|2.0

And I was not disappointed in the least. Nor was my ever crankier partner, who has narrowed his range of acceptable food choices to only a few items; which makes dining out a bit tricky. This is a well done nicely thought out casual menu served up in a light filled corner location with lots of windows, perfect for people watching.   For dinner, our party of four started with 3 appetizers, charred shishito peppers, some truffled Parmesan fries and small bowl of pickled vegetables. All were perfect finger food bites to go along with some really stellar cocktails- loved the Singing Fountain. For entrees, a double cheeseburger proclaimed excellent., a generous entree sized Cobb salad, zucchini spaghetti primavera, a light offering of summers best veggies and a chicken gravy - a sort of savory Dutch baby with egg sauce etc. Two desserts of a blueberry tart and some malted milk ice cream with homemade peanut brittle,  completed  the evening along with some delicious coffee and espresso.  For dinner, with moderate drinking and three courses  I would figure on spending $60 -75 per person with tax and tip. Though it would be quite easy to have a lovely meal here for half that price.   We are all looking forward to our next visit for breakfast/lunch.|en|https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g60795-d10202605-r848476010-Reviews-The_Dutch-Philadelphia_Pennsylvania.html?m=66827#review848476010|pookala|NONE|2022-07-31|1.0

Aware that most hotel lifts need a card to make them work we asked at the front desk and they just told us to go up to the 19th floor.  We went up as far as the 14th where a customer got in the lift and we started to descend again.  Luckily this customer used their room key to press for the 19th and once everyone got out in the lobby we went back up again.   The young lady serving was very polite and friendly but was on her own and the two people who were behind the desk did not attempt to help her.   We ordered starters and a main and after a half hour wait all the food came out together.  The main was warm but not hot as was the starter the toast had been hot at some point but was definitely cold by the time it got to us.

Just down the block, we found SOUTH—and what a serendipitous switch it turned out to be. Despite having no reservation, we were seated at the Chef’s Table, which gave us a fascinating view into the workings of the kitchen. Watching the culinary team in action added a whole new layer to the experience—impressive, precise, and full of energy. Our server, Bryn (Taylor/Tay), was exceptional. She knew the menu inside and out, offered thoughtful recommendations, and made us feel genuinely welcomed. Her warmth and professionalism elevated the entire evening. We started with drinks: I had the watermelon sangria—refreshing and perfectly balanced—and my husband enjoyed a classic sweet tea, which was just right. For appetizers, we chose the Spiced Shrimp Deviled Eggs and Bayou Chicken Gumbo. Both were flavorful and comforting, with just the right amount of Southern flair. For entrées, we had the Charleston Shrimp & Grits and the Eastern Shore Crab Cakes. The shrimp and grits were creamy, bold, and beautifully seasoned. The crab cakes were delicate yet packed with flavor—no filler, just fresh crab and thoughtful seasoning. The atmosphere was lively and elegant. Though we weren’t seated in the jazz room, we could still hear the music drifting in, adding a soulful backdrop to the evening. The vibe was festive, with guests clearly enjoying themselves. SOUTH strikes a rare balance: upscale without being pretentious, soulful without being heavy. If you're looking for a place that delivers great food, warm service, and a touch of magic, SOUTH is it. We came in disappointed and left delighted.|en|https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g60795-d8852600-r1026704940-Reviews-South_Kitchen_Jazz_Parlor-Philadelphia_Pennsylvania.html?m=66827#review1026704940|672jeanined|Couples|2025-08-31|

My friend ordered quesadilla and I ordered pasta. The friend asked for salsa (what quesadilla comes without salsa?) and the server said they were out and would have to check. I asked for a spoon to go along with my pasta because I am Italian and always use a fork and spoon. An update on the salsa and a spoon never arrived. How do you run out of store bought salsa (doubt they would make homemade)????? My pasta was not really that hot and I should have sent it back to be warmed up but then thought I might not even see the dish again.

The detail to every aspect of the food preparation is evident, along with the variety and uniqueness of every dish.  The servers are very approachable and extremely knowledgeable about every dish. The meal starts with seasonal snacks and progresses through vegetable tastings and a variety of proteins.  The meal ends with a dessert or two that in a perfect ending to a magnificent culinary experience!  I visit Philadelphia solo and never feel awkward or out of place dining by myself at this restaurant.  This is definitely a very upscale restaurant but pulls that off without being pretentious or snobby.  The upstairs tasting menu dining room is cozy yet comfortable.  I really can't say enough about the restaurant!  It is expensive, but should be thought of as an experience more than just a dinner.  In my opinion, the quality justifies the experience.  An added bonus to the tasting menu is the great wine and cocktail selections.  Friday Saturday Sunday really cares about it's patrons.  I look forward to seeing the hostess when I walk in, as she remembers me from previous visits.  That's pretty amazing considering the number of people that walk through that door.|en|https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g60795-d461494-r1017655413-Reviews-Friday_Saturday_Sunday-Philadelphia_Pennsylvania.html?m=66827#review1017655413|kiwiandmolly|Solo travel|2025-07-31|

It's definitely a restaurant for a special occasion!  The tasting menu is pricey but in my opinion well worth it.  I experienced eight courses of unique and delicious dishes, each served by amazing servers who could explain the intricacies of the dishes so well.  Although this is definitely a high end restaurant, it never feels stuffy or pretentious.  I dined alone and was made to feel comfortable and as special as if I was with an important group.  Starting with the seasonal snacks to the halibut dish, pasta, and steak, each dish was immaculately prepared and served.  Dessert was an amazing chocolate cake, a vanilla type custard/ice cream, and an extra chocolate coated piece of heaven!  I did not choose the optional wine pairing, but instead enjoyed one of their cocktails, an Orange Catholic.  They are known for their cocktails as well and this one was amazing!|en|https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g60795-d461494-r996376270-Reviews-Friday_Saturday_Sunday-Philadelphia_Pennsylvania.html?m=66827#review996376270|kiwiandmolly|Solo travel|2025-02-28|

We were told there was a dining room upstairs, but my wife and I sat at the bar with friends. Although it was a sober night for me, the rest of my group ordered one of the cocktails from the menu that was expertly crafted by a friendly mixologist named Paul. The playlist set the tone for a fun Friday night and the volume was a perfect level for conversation and in seat dancing. This place is a hot spot with folks waiting up to an hour or more to dine at the bar, and frankly, the food is more than worth the wait. It is a culinary delight with high art presentation. It really engaged the five senses, yes even sound; I could hear the crisp of the skin as I bit into the roasted chicken. A rich sensory experience.

The subtle lasting taste of each course was memorable, and the transition to dessert was also quite impressive. The food was absolutely sumptuous. We were fortunate enough to have a very experienced server and he was also terrific. At one point my wife and I were not quite sure about one of the courses and the waiter very clearly said, try it, and if you still don’t like it, we will find something else.

That is, until you actually explore and find that there's nothing worth visiting around there. Yes, lots of stores and some restaurants, but really none of note. The hotel itself is pretty old, and in disappointing condition given that it is managed by a 4-star airline. My room door, wooden and creaky, had to be forced shut. Lighting in the room was laughably crooked, no minibar, no free bottled water, furniture very dated, bathtub missing stopper. Room control panel near the bed is difficult to figure out (i.e. no English), even for a seasoned traveler. The check-in staff were friendly, but when I checked out I couldn't find my key they charged me 30rmb for it. In the States I usually keep my keys but in China many Chinese hotels demand return. No big deal, but 30rmb is steep compared to the room price, which is actually the best thing about the hotel. There's also free internet and surprise surprise HBO. It was dirt cheap at under $30 a night, so based on that I am giving this 3 stars rather than 2.|en|https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g294213-d1070951-r82417411-Reviews-Hanting_Express_Chongqing_Shangqingsi-Chongqing.html?m=66827#review82417411|BB_in_BJ|Business|2010-06-30|1.0

After paying the admission fee, we received a quick overview of the site and went on our way. We opted to view some of the outdoor exhibits first, which included the guard house and press house. The press house contained multiple informational plaques about President Hardings wife and her contributions to society. After viewing the press house, we made our way to the front porch of the house, where we waited for the 10 am guided hour tour to begin. There were guided tours of the presidents former house being held every hour throughout the day. The guided tour of the house was very informational, and the tour guide took us from room to room, while pointing out interesting features and artifacts out for display. The tour guide told us several personal stories related to the Hardings time at the house. The guided tour lasted roughly 1 hour.  After viewing the house, we went back inside to view the main exhibits. We opted to watch a short documentary about President Hardings life and some of the trials and tribulations he faced during his time as President. There were multiple informational plaques out for display, many of them quite text heavy, that went into detail about Hardings upbringing and roots as the owner of a newspaper company in Marion. The plaques also talked about election day, and several of the policy’s Harding implemented while in office. The last section of the museum dealt with his death and some controversial issues that surrounded his presidency. There were multiple artifacts out for display in the museum, along with short video clips that related to President Harding's time in office.

We got their Adventure Platter to start (which happened to come easily divisible by 4). Love the grape leaves.  Loved the hummus.  The falafel was also quite tasty. So, clearly I recommend it. From there, we split the Haneeth & Mandi Duo, which resulted in plenty of leftovers even after we all had our fill.

There were a couple positives -- staff were lovely and Audrey's wine pairing, while poured with a stingy hand, was well planned and full of interesting choices.   The food was the real dissapointment. First, there just wasn't enough of it. We left hungry and got fries on the way home. Not what you want paying more than $500 for dinner. The food ranged from pretty good -- the rockfish, the blue cheese puff -- to pretty bad -- under seasoned and dry pork belly (like how do you even make pork belly too dry?). Nothing we ate was memorable in a good way.  We've been to a lot of Michelin star restaurants and I have no idea what happened here. Is the chef doing Paleo? Give us some pasta or a potato or something more than tiny slivers of fish and radishes for all this money. I know everything is more expensive these days but a dinner like this shouldn't leave people hungry.|en|https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g28970-d10076070-r951619031-Reviews-Tail_Up_Goat-Washington_DC_District_of_Columbia.html?m=66827#review951619031|PandaEnRoute|Couples|2024-05-31|2.0

Furthermore, if you’d love to be contradicted by a waiter in a most rude manner, this might also be perfect for you. The food was fine, small portions, big prices, but tapas restaurants seem to be like that anyway. That is not the point. When I asked for pulpo asado (octopus) they brought fried breaded calamari. Even an elementary school kid the difference between squid and octopus. The extremely rude waiter contradicted me when I mentioned that this was not octopus, it was calamari. Octopi do not have rings!! Squid have rings and octopi have tentacles with suction cups. It was so obvious to the point of pathetic that it was funny how the man was dead set on contradicting us and in the most rude fashion. If I were the manager, which we did not contact because we didn’t want to make a scene, this guy would have been in the street right away. When I confronted him and asked him why we got calamari instead of octopus, he said “the chef knows what he’s doing thank you” and he left the table in a huff.

If you want a nice room for a special occasion, it probably fits the bill.  But for its high prices ($98 for a 1/4 lamb rack for example and wine prices that are typically 3x retail) we expect a bit more.  Bread was excellent.  Appetizers good (tuna tartare and tomato soup); but my duck was overcooked and quite tough this time — it’s a dish I’ve had there multiple times and the last 2 it’s been sub-par.  My husband’s entree was fine but not impressive.  Profiteroles for dessert were ok, but the ice cream was only Ok, a bit icy and not very creamy.  Wines by the bottle range from expensive to ridiculous in price.  It’s a solid but not very imaginative list.  The Italian section had a good Chianti for only 2.5x retail — most wines were 3-4 times retail (and not ones they’ve been cellaring for years).  But we left disappointed for the second time and will not be returning.  Much better food available elsewhere in Boston, and if you’re willing to pay super high prices, you’ll be better satisfied somewhere like La Padrona where the prices guarantee excellent food and the wine list is far more interesting (as long as your focus that night is Italian).|en|https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g60745-d321911-r1031350542-Reviews-Mistral-Boston_Massachusetts.html?m=66827#review1031350542|ChelseaMATraveler|Couples|2025-09-30|

The steaks and duck were truly delicious. However the rack of lamb for $95 was ordinary and a ripoff. The waiter described “very large” rib chops but instead they presented a bare plate with 3 puny chops. They tasted fine but were ordinary. The salad was drowned in a balsamic that was so acidic that it was difficult and unpleasant to eat. It was also just a pile of lettuce thrown into a bowl with a few minute mushrooms.  I’d think carefully before trying Mistral agsin|en|https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g60745-d321911-r1020760035-Reviews-Mistral-Boston_Massachusetts.html?m=66827#review1020760035|440laineyl|Friends getaway|2025-07-31|

What a welcome !!! Myself and Grandaughter   ( from the UK ) were visiting my son who is currently living and working in Boston and it was our first time in the beautiful city . He booked it as a special evening and it certainly was . The  bread basket with whipped butter was delicious … The Calamari starter was huge and so glad we shared it , my salmon and asparagus risotto was cooked perfectly.  My Grandaughter had spaghetti with clams ..first time she has had this and said it was amazing ,   my son had the a 16 oz steak .. we were so full but  I desperately wanted to try the key lime pie so we shared one portion and so glad we did , schamazing !!! as it’s so popular we got almost the last one .. it is homemade by one of the bar staff .. who makes 3 of the deserts on the menu .. it is  truly divine … we had an amazing experience there all due to the the Manager and the wonderful  server Julie .. Julie has been there 25 years and a truly outstanding waitress , they do really look after you and made our special trip to Boston  a truly memorable one. I had tears at the table when seeing all the effort they had gone to .. never have I experienced such joyful moments with lovely people working there .

Made the reservation online, you were asked if it was for a special occasion, and I said yes for a birthday, and there was a place for comments and I requested a table instead of a booth and when we got there, they knew exactly what we were looking for and seated us accordingly. There was also a small happy birthday sign on the table with some happy birthday confetti around the candle on in the center of the table.   The staff from the hostess to the weight staff, were all outgoing and customer oriented.    We got the Caesar salad, shared a shrimp cocktail, shared lobster mac & cheese. One of us got the ribeye, and one of us got the fillet.    Everything we had was exceptional.   The flavors were spot on, and the portions were generous. The shrimp cocktail came with four jumbo shrimp, which were truly jumbo.   After the salad and the shrimp, we managed to each eat a little bit of the mac & cheese and some of our steaks. We took the rest home for leftovers.   We also ordered a piece of carrot cake to go. The carrot cake was OK and the portion was ridiculously large. The carrot cake is the only not great part of the experience, but certainly not a showstopper.

It was all about customer service, timing the meals properly and the dining experience. I was front and back of the house. I let it slide that this place did all bottled cocktails??  Bc I was so excited to see my friend. But no bar to make a proper drink-noted. Then upon arrival…..we were notified that there was a reservation 1.5 hours later so essentially “don’t hurry but hurry up.”  Slightly off putting but We agreed and got back to our bottled Negronis. Then not even 10 minutes later, another staff member came by and asked if we made any decisions. We hadn’t yet. She then told us “we just want to make sure we’re on the same page that there are people coming at 7:30.”  That was it. Bill please?  We were done.

Many items were off menu, but not all. We started with beet arancini (yum!), then a liver mousse ball, meatballs (the most traditional Italian of the dishes), followed by rainbow carrots over ricotta with sugared ginger, bacalao on toast, tuna crudo (our least favorite), clams with grilled bread, two pasta dishes and a panacotta, fig, peach tuile dessert!

The Library (aka Museum) is quite small compared to other presidential libraries, but does a good job telling the story of Harding's short presidency. Tours of his home are only offered on the hour, so we had to miss that, but did take photos from the outside. We also visited the Harding Memorial in the cemetery, which was quite impressive. If you're passing by Marion, Ohio, take a break from your drive and stop by to see the presidential sites.|en|https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g50609-d103249-r1035555428-Reviews-Warren_G_Harding_Presidential_Sites-Marion_Ohio.html?m=66827#review1035555428|lithlith|Couples|2025-10-31|

Harding Presidential Sites|Great trip. We arrived at approximately 9:30 am and made our way towards the entrance of the museum. After paying the admission fee, we received a quick overview of the site and went on our way. We opted to view some of the outdoor exhibits first, which included the guard house and press house. The press house contained multiple informational plaques about President Hardings wife and her contributions to society. After viewing the press house, we made our way to the front porch of the house, where we waited for the 10 am guided hour tour to begin. There were guided tours of the presidents former house being held every hour throughout the day. The guided tour of the house was very informational, and the tour guide took us from room to room, while pointing out interesting features and artifacts out for display. The tour guide told us several personal stories related to the Hardings time at the house. The guided tour lasted roughly 1 hour.  After viewing the house, we went back inside to view the main exhibits. We opted to watch a short documentary about President Hardings life and some of the trials and tribulations he faced during his time as President. There were multiple informational plaques out for display, many of them quite text heavy, that went into detail about Hardings upbringing and roots as the owner of a newspaper company in Marion. The plaques also talked about election day, and several of the policy’s Harding implemented while in office. The last section of the museum dealt with his death and some controversial issues that surrounded his presidency. There were multiple artifacts out for display in the museum, along with short video clips that related to President Harding's time in office.  Tip: I recommend spending 3 hours here if you truly want to see everything.|en|https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g50609-d103249-r989351848-Reviews-Warren_G_Harding_Presidential_Sites-Marion_Ohio.html?m=66827#review989351848|PartyTheNightAway|Solo travel|2024-07-31|

And I was not disappointed in the least. Nor was my ever crankier partner, who has narrowed his range of acceptable food choices to only a few items; which makes dining out a bit tricky. This is a well done nicely thought out casual menu served up in a light filled corner location with lots of windows, perfect for people watching.   For dinner, our party of four started with 3 appetizers, charred shishito peppers, some truffled Parmesan fries and small bowl of pickled vegetables. All were perfect finger food bites to go along with some really stellar cocktails- loved the Singing Fountain. For entrees, a double cheeseburger proclaimed excellent., a generous entree sized Cobb salad, zucchini spaghetti primavera, a light offering of summers best veggies and a chicken gravy - a sort of savory Dutch baby with egg sauce etc. Two desserts of a blueberry tart and some malted milk ice cream with homemade peanut brittle,  completed  the evening along with some delicious coffee and espresso.  For dinner, with moderate drinking and three courses  I would figure on spending $60 -75 per person with tax and tip. Though it would be quite easy to have a lovely meal here for half that price.   We are all looking forward to our next visit for breakfast/lunch.|en|https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g60795-d10202605-r848476010-Reviews-The_Dutch-Philadelphia_Pennsylvania.html?m=66827#review848476010|pookala|NONE|2022-07-31|1.0

Aware that most hotel lifts need a card to make them work we asked at the front desk and they just told us to go up to the 19th floor.  We went up as far as the 14th where a customer got in the lift and we started to descend again.  Luckily this customer used their room key to press for the 19th and once everyone got out in the lobby we went back up again.   The young lady serving was very polite and friendly but was on her own and the two people who were behind the desk did not attempt to help her.   We ordered starters and a main and after a half hour wait all the food came out together.  The main was warm but not hot as was the starter the toast had been hot at some point but was definitely cold by the time it got to us.

I dined here with my girlfriend for our anniversary and it was a mixed experience for sure.  Pros: the food and service (by Katie) were 5-star as both were excellent, some of the best tapas I've ever had. The entire 5-course meal was excellent.  Cons: 1) If you're going to order the 5-course or chef's tasting menu DO NOT make a later reservation. We came in at 8:30, ordered the 5-course option and by our 2nd course we were the only table left and the staff was cleaning up around us making us feel very uncomfortable, like we were holding them up from closing. 2) Review your bill VERY carefully because there will be odd charges on it. First off, we were charged $70 for a bottle of wine listed for $65 on the menu. Secondly, we were charged a $13 ""beverage tax"" on the alcohol. When I said to the manager, ""so between the sales tax and the beverage tax, you're taxing us twice on the alcohol, right?"" He replied ""yes"". The Phila. beverage tax is intended to sweetened drinks like soda, energy drinks, etc. and is NOT intended for alcohol. We dine in Phila all the time and we've NEVER been charged such a silly charge. We were also charged $8 for using a credit card (which was already on the bill before we even paid). What if we paid with cash? When I told the manager that it's illegal to charge a fee for using a debit card and showed him proof on my phone, he merely looked at me. So we basically paid an extra $25 for nonsense after dropping $250 there.   Will we go back? No we won't. As I said the meal and service were fantastic but feeling rushed when you've ordered a multi-course meal and then being nickel-and-dimed with illegal charges basically ruined an excellent meal and our anniversary dinner. This is especially disappointing given that this is a Townsend Wentz restaurant."|en|https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g60795-d13275000-r988775484-Reviews-Oloroso-Philadelphia_Pennsylvania.html?m=66827#review988775484|L8945JQdavidd|Couples|2025-01-31|

If you make an 8:30 reservation DO NOT choose the 5 course option or chefs choice. You will not have time to fully enjoy the experience.  We weren't even at desert when the place was empty and everyone was cleaning up around us and the bartender left. The music got louder and we were told that if we were uncomfortable we could wrap up the final courses to go. If at the end you still plan going. Keep your choices Ala carte and not so many. 2. We get the bill. Now like most trusting people who aren't expecting to get ripped off we would have just paid but because our server forgot to add our bottle of wine (no problem, these things happen) I decided to look at the check to make sure the rest was right. First thing I see is the beverage tax. In Philly the beverage tax is applied to sweet drinks and energy drinks NOT alcoholic drinks. We did not have what the tax is intended for. We were also charged an $8 credit card fee. With this one-how did they know I'd use a charge card? What if I paid with cash. That aside I did use a DEBIT card. A debit card is the same as cash and cannot be charged a fee. We even googled these things when speaking to the manager to say hey, we're not making this up! When you say to a manager ""you're taxing us twice for the bottle of wine?"" and he says ""YES"", there's a problem.  He even removed the beverage tax. (The manager was great and unless the owner would prefer he lied and look stupid,  he did his job) at this point I wasn't going to argue the credit card charge, though he was aware that it was wrong, these people don't make the big money and wanted to go home. This is a Townsend Wentz restaurant. We have eaten at Townsend as well as Amano. We couldn't recall if these charges were applied there in the underhanded way they were applied here but again, we're people who trust and don't expect to get ripped off. I'm thinking the owners are putting their bets on that. Honestly, of the many, many restaurants we have dined at in Philly, this was a first. My son-in-law is a chef and restaurant owner. He'd never risk his reputation by putting a beverage tax on alcohol served or charge the customer $8 for the use of a debit card (let alone put it on the bill before knowing how the customer is paying).  Yes, the food and service was fantastic, so if you're ok with $25 in taxes-the majority of which should NOT be charged-and the knowledge you're being taken advantage of...Townsend Wentz will give you that."|en|https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g60795-d13275000-r988684316-Reviews-Oloroso-Philadelphia_Pennsylvania.html?m=66827#review988684316|M2156GYnancye|Family|2025-01-31|

This fancy speakeasy has no name on the door, just a gold plaque with a rose on it. You have to ring the doorbell when you arrive and a secret panel opens in the door for the host to speak through. I found it on a list of “cozy and romantic” restaurants with great reviews. It is very dark, with bookshelves, and mismatched vintage plates (which fit the décor I guess, but I would have expected something more minimal.   It is very popular and by the time we made a reservation (on a Thursday night), the only available time was 8:45pm. This was already late for our preference, but we thought we’d try it since everyone raved about it. We arrived early at 8:30pm to see if our table was ready. They said it was not, and the people currently seated had just ordered dessert. They recommended we get a drink nearby and they would text us when the table was ready. We waited at our hotel lobby around the corner, thinking it wouldn’t be that long. We received a text at 9:06pm that said “Your table is now ready at Alpen Rose!” When we arrived a few minutes later, we rang the bell again, only for them to tell us it was still NOT ready. There was a rowdy party of 5 guys also at the door that were taken in before us.   It was almost 9:30pm by the time we were seated. Starving, we ordered oysters Rockefeller. Being so late we asked if we could put in our entrée orders but was told that “the chef likes to course it out”. We were surprised by (who we assumed was) a manager bringing us a complimentary appetizer of tuna carpaccio, however I do not eat raw fish. She left with it and came back to ask if we would like shrimp cocktail instead (which my husband is allergic to). We imagine they were trying to make up for being late, but never asked our preference. She finally brought out a wedge salad, like it or not (which was good, even though I don’t eat bacon).   It was very noisy and we were right on top of the people on either side of us – not romantic at all (the space is very small, seating maybe 40 people). The only good thing were the drinks (we had No. 3 and 21). Vegetables and starch sides do not come with the main dish, you must buy them separately (the asparagus was large but tender and tasty). I ordered the branzino, which she said would have some bones but were large and in almost every bite. We were shocked that my husband’s $56 filet was so tough it was hard to cut! Two small dessert bites showed up at the end of the meal, but they did not make up for the poor performance at this price point.   We were seated next to the noisy guys who came before us, so in the end we tried to make the best of it, joking and trading photos with them and being entertained by their drinks covered with smoke, massive Tomahawk cavemen bone steaks, and flaming baked Alaska with a sparkler. Maybe at 50 we are older than the typical crowd, and now we know not to make a reservation that late (especially when the times are not honored), but a pricey establishment like this should know better how to space out their reservations. I would not recommend this restaurant to anyone, even given the hype.|en|https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g60795-d17393600-r1009031490-Reviews-Alpen_Rose-Philadelphia_Pennsylvania.html?m=66827#review1009031490|jennifersU6289CV|Couples|2025-05-31|2.0

Dry aged is the house specialty and they didn’t get it right. I ordered the dry aged rib eye medium rare. First time out, the meat was a true medium. With appropriate apologies, they cooked another. This came out a true medium rare. However, there was so much char on the meat, I could not taste the subtle taste of a $78 piece of meat. Okay, not happy, but we wouldn’t come back. We were offered a free dessert. Now, at the table adjacent to us, the couple ordered a filet medium rare. Theirs too came out grey. And, like ours, the char was so heavy they said it over-powered the taste of the meat. Finally, our complimentary dessert. It’s prime peach time and they had warm peach pie with ice cream. It had a huge puff pastry crust that had no flavor. And worse, the peach cubes were cold, hard and tasteless. In the middle of peach season. Top all this off with tables so close together that when the server was pouring our neighbors wine, their ass was right in my face. Literally, right there. The only redeeming feature was the cocktails and whisky list. This was our third try of restaurants in this chain. Thy Mary and Pearl Oyster House was okay, but The Oyster House is much better. The Giusseppe restaurant was average; Villa Di Roma is a better choice. And Barkley Prime far outshines Alpen Rose.|en|https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g60795-d17393600-r966764427-Reviews-Alpen_Rose-Philadelphia_Pennsylvania.html?m=66827#review966764427|I6060NTrobs|Couples|2024-08-31|2.0

We live nearby but have never been.  We made a res for 1:45 (late for brunch). The place was 1/2 empty but we were seated at a table for 2 at a banquette squeezed between 2 noisy groups and very close to the front door which brought in icy air.  I looked at a long expanse of empty tables and asked if we could sit over there and was told no; they were expecting a big party.  Note:  the big party arrived one hour later when we were ready to leave.  Also 2 other couples arrived and were seated in the forbidden zone. Okay that was #1.  Then no wait person showed up for a longish period of time: #2: no water; no welcome.  Menu was okay.  We both ordered a different version of a salad with grilled salmon. Mine included a poached egg. #3 poached egg arrived hard boiled. I asked for a replacement t and they did bring me a softly poached, runny egg.  We waited a ridiculous amount of time for someone to refill our iced tea. #4: food was mediocre.  Edible but no where near the quality anticipated based on the prices.  I do not recommend this place and would not go back.  Plenty of far better places a short walk away.|en|https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g60795-d24006786-r982871934-Reviews-Wilder-Philadelphia_Pennsylvania.html?m=66827#review982871934|susansR8341FV|Couples|2024-12-31|

I believe this was our third or fourth time dining there. I had the Roasted Chicken with Gnocchi and my wife had the Handmade Ricotta Ravioli. To say they were both good would be an understatement. My wife usually never finishes her entree (she did), and it was the absolute best chicken I have ever eaten (anywhere). The only thing that would have made it any better would have been a nice piece of crusty bread to lap up the sauce, as licking the plate would have probably been in bad taste!

The best thing that could be said about my dish were the two blistered cherry tomatoes were tasty.  The bead size scallops were rubbery, the small amt of sauce was incredibly bland, and the dish was dry. The side garden salads were very nice size, fresh and good.  The salted caramel cheesecake was amazing and strangely enough, the decaf coffee  was truly terrific.  However, a $97 meal (we ordered no alcohol) with mushy vegetables and a non-edible entree was a big disappointment.

Warning - Diner beware! The menu is exactly what you get, there are no options & there are no substitutions. Limited menu's are not a problem but I have found most restaurants offer at least a choice of vegetable & some bread & or side salad as part of the overall meal. Not this one. The night we were there, dinner came with garlic mashed potatoes & vegetable medley, no other options, no substitutions no exceptions. If you dislike something, like say, garlic or green beans too darned bad. I had the chicken Garcia, my partner had the 16 oz ribeye and a side salad, we both drank water. When the bill came we were shocked! Our meal came to almost $95! My chicken was $24, the side salad was $5, My partner's ribeye was $59!  Yes, it was listed as MP(Market Price), which means the price varies with the cost of the ingredients but really? I know the high price wasn't in the mashed potatoes or vegetable medley or my chicken dinner would have cost more so it must have been the steak.  It was tasty but it was not $59 worth of tasty.

The food itself was delicious, but when I got home and looked over my receipt, I realized I was charged for two meals instead of one for several items. I double-checked to make sure it wasn't something I ordered by mistake--it definitely wasn't.  I am not sure how this is even possible since only one item of each was delivered to our table.  Is it a scam???  The total amount overcharged was $109.   I tried calling and emailing the restaurant to sort it out, but haven't been able to get a response yet. Mistakes happen, but overcharging a customer and not fixing it right away doesn't leave a good impression.   Please double-check your bill before you leave!  I hope management sees this and reaches out so this can be corrected.

Now there are only two Mexican restaurants in town. But coworkers have told me they weren't impressed whatsoever with the other place   I really felt like having some flautas. They had them on the menu but clarified that they were made corn tortillas. In my book, those are taquitos...and it was indicated on the menu. So I asked the waiter if they would make them with flour tortillas. He said no at first but then said he'd check with the cook. He returned and said no problem. While waiting I was served some salsa & chips...which were pretty average. I also had a Modelo Especial. My flautas (3) were very good and I recommend you request them this way if you order them. I even told my waiter he should suggest the option to his restaurant patrons.  Because of the pandemic, they created a drive up window, but don't know if you're required to call in your order ahead. Prices were average and the staff was nice. There's a small bar but I believe they only sell beer. There's a couple TV monitors inside. No complaints and nothing to rave about.

This seems to be the least critical review of all written about Panda although most found the food good.  Sure the place doesn't look as fancy as others but it also isn't pretentious as some buffets and if it keeps costs down, I have absolutely no complaints and everyone agrees it is well worth the price.  I'm not foolish enough to think I can have it both ways, fancy decorations and extras with the lowest prices, especially because it was a clean place, the waiter brought our drinks three times, was courteous, wore a mask as all the staff and I felt safe and taken care of.  The watermelon was sweet and juicy, ice cream was the real kind, not soft serve and I enjoyed and finished every dish I took.  They were cooked and seasoned perfectly.  The vegetable dishes were fresh and crispy, never overcooked to a mush like some southern vegetables tend to be.  None of the food was old or lacked freshness.

I ordered the trash plate which was hash browns with ham, bacon, veggies and cheese. It came with a biscuit and I asked for gravy on the side and a Pepsi. I asked to substitute ham and bacon on the hashbrowns with patty sausage. It came out quickly and it was delicious. On my ticket $3 was written beside patty sausage. When I went to pay I asked the lady if she charged me $3 for a patty sausage when I didn't get it extra, but I substituted. Because the $3 was beside the patty sausage it looked like I was charged extra for it. She says no that's for your Pepsi. (My Pepsi wasn't on the ticket at all)  I replied ""ok"" and handed her my card. She then proceeded to read to me the rest of my ticket and the prices. I told her I just wasn't sure about the $3 because it was written beside the patty sausage. She then states ""It's not a calculator. I'm only human.""  I was nothing short of polite as I asked, responded to, and accepted her explanation.  Looking at the other reviews I believe every one of them. Even her replies to the 1 star reviews are snarky. I understand that people can get stressed and have a rough day causing them to not be as polite as they usually would, but it's obvious that this lady's rudness is a character trait she seems to be proud of.

More of a cook to order deal, but that's just fine with me because the wait is well worth it and I like my food hot and fully cooked (which it always has been at this place).

There is history of the area from ancient times and also more recently including a diorama of the railway in the area. There is also a bit of history about women politicians in the area. I did not realise that Theresa May was not the first lady politician in the area of note.  The most interesting thing to see in the centre is the ATA on the first floor. Colin shared a great deal about the men and women who served in this organisation. There is alot of information on display and it is impressive that this collection of exhibits is available to educate people like me.

I explained that the youngest is only 8 (they recommend 9) but is almost 9 and is quite tall (to reach the pedals) The person I spoke to was friendly and helpful and reassured me it would be fine but suggested we book a 1 hour session which we did. This cost £70 which I thought was reasonable value for 4 of them to have a try.   On arriving at the centre, the person at the front desk was very helpful and suggested that we could park one of our cars for free in the drive at the side as they only had one staff car parked there that day. We parked the other one (as we had 4 children with us) in the  Pay car park at the other side.   The centre itself is small but with some interesting exhibits. There is also a video which they can put on and that is very informative about the role of the ADA during the war. And there’s a dressing up section which amused the children who weren’t on the simulator and which kept them out of the way as I was a bit concerned that the guy supervising  (Richard) was slightly flustered by the number of them!! He said quite sharply that he needed to know this in advance and I explained that I had called to check that would be ok.  In the event they did all have the opportunity to operate the simulator, to loop the loop, do a barrel role and land the plane. And they all said they enjoyed it but said later that they didn’t really feel they were doing it themselves as Richard had his hands on the controls at all times……..possibly in case they crashed it??!! And I don’t think he took to our youngest grandson who went last and was definitely over-confident which possibly annoyed Richard.  All in all, I think it’s probably more suited to older children or adults who may have had more experience with video games than ours have.  Our oldest grandson (at nearly 12) was the one who found it most interesting. The youngest was actually the most enthusiastic but was a bit too boisterous for Richard’s liking!! I also think that if I had been in charge I would probably have structured it differently. I think he could have explained the more general rules to all of them at the start and then allowed each of them to have a turn. Instead he went through with each individually which took more time and therefore reduced the time available for the flying.|en|https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g186418-d3250123-r953161378-Reviews-Maidenhead_Heritage_Centre-Maidenhead_Windsor_and_Maidenhead_Berkshire_England.html?m=66827#review953161378|Mocampion|Family|2024-05-31|

The ""hostess"" behind the counter was less than warm and cheerful, and that combined with the lack of ambiance almost made us leave.  However, they had fried oysters on the menu which I'd been craving so we stayed. I had the oysters and absolutely tasteless coleslaw.  The oysters themselves were plump and juicy, but the breading was too heavy and flavorless.  My husband had grilled shrimp wrapped in bacon and fries.  Bacon was basically raw and shrimp, which plump, were tasteless.   Prices were higher than they should be in a place like this.  If it was going for a seaside hut vibe, they definitely missed it.

Well, I certainly should have because this was the worst tasting chicken Parmesan sandwich I’ve ever had. I asked for extra cheese there was no cheese no sauce and when I first looked at it, I thought they had given me eggplant by mistake. That’s how thin and burnt the chicken cutlet was. It was literally all bread no meat to thin hockey pucks just terrible and they charged me $16 for it.

The weekend brunch is really fine and happy hour runs all day on Saturday (11am to 6pm) with 1/2 price wines by the glass and bottle. Staff is friendly and knowledgeable m- they are normally quite attentive. This visit was a bit different. While my husband’s burger was perfectly prepared, his request for Dijon mustard went unfulfilled for more than 10 minutes and required requests to three separate servers before the condiment arrived. Our server provided a complimentary sparkling wine, a nice gesture but too little too late. His meal had cooled and I was well into my lunch by then. Very disappointing. We will eat here again.

Right at the start, the waitress made a rude comment about my husband ordering tap water, which already set the wrong tone.  After ordering our drinks, we were told to grab salad from the salad bar. I wasn’t even halfway through my salad when, within about six minutes, they brought around six different types of meat. Everything felt extremely rushed, to the point where I had to turn my ticket to “no” because it was all coming too fast. I’ve been to Brazil, and even there the service is never this hurried.  My husband didn’t take any salad, so he was only eating meat. After about 45 minutes, they took away our plates, making it clear we wouldn’t receive any more food. The food and drinks themselves were actually good, and if we hadn’t felt rushed and unwelcome, we would’ve gladly ordered more drinks and even dessert.  They say they want to give you an “experience,” but unfortunately this was not a good one.|en|https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g60805-d8067010-r1039882414-Reviews-Terra_Gaucha_Brazilian_Steakhouse_Jacksonville_FL-Jacksonville_Florida.html?m=66827#review1039882414|wendydg1981|Couples|2025-11-30|

When we got back to the table sat down they brought our drinks. One guy sat down my son drink, and it spilled all over the table. They moved everything from the center of the table, put down a towel and blotted  up what they could of the Coke and then another or a girl came around to my side between me and my daughter and she picked the glass up off the tray and I guess the tray was not centered and a whole cup of beverage spilled between me and my daughter on the floor it splattered on her brand new UGG shoes.

Is it a scam???  The total amount overcharged was $109.   I tried calling and emailing the restaurant to sort it out, but haven't been able to get a response yet. Mistakes happen, but overcharging a customer and not fixing it right away doesn't leave a good impression.   Please double-check your bill before you leave!

The staff were professional and friendly - our waitress was very helpful when we were struggling to decide what to order. The crispy duck, salmon satay, tempura cauliflower, and the general tso soup were outstanding! We ended up not leaving anything for leftovers, which doesn't generally happen with us. We'll definitely come back the next time we're in town.|en|https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g60795-d1903121-r988692783-Reviews-Sampan-Philadelphia_Pennsylvania.html?m=66827#review988692783|dustythoughts|Friends getaway|2025-01-31|

The Library (aka Museum) is quite small compared to other presidential libraries, but does a good job telling the story of Harding's short presidency. Tours of his home are only offered on the hour, so we had to miss that, but did take photos from the outside. We also visited the Harding Memorial in the cemetery, which was quite impressive. If you're passing by Marion, Ohio, take a break from your drive and stop by to see the presidential sites.|en|https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g50609-d103249-r1035555428-Reviews-Warren_G_Harding_Presidential_Sites-Marion_Ohio.html?m=66827#review1035555428|lithlith|Couples|2025-10-31|

The museum has nice exhibits with a couple audios. Enjoyed watching the pictures taken on the Voyage of Understanding tour to the western states and Alaska.

Harding Presidential Sites|Great trip. We arrived at approximately 9:30 am and made our way towards the entrance of the museum. After paying the admission fee, we received a quick overview of the site and went on our way. We opted to view some of the outdoor exhibits first, which included the guard house and press house. The press house contained multiple informational plaques about President Hardings wife and her contributions to society. After viewing the press house, we made our way to the front porch of the house, where we waited for the 10 am guided hour tour to begin. There were guided tours of the presidents former house being held every hour throughout the day. The guided tour of the house was very informational, and the tour guide took us from room to room, while pointing out interesting features and artifacts out for display. The tour guide told us several personal stories related to the Hardings time at the house. The guided tour lasted roughly 1 hour.  After viewing the house, we went back inside to view the main exhibits. We opted to watch a short documentary about President Hardings life and some of the trials and tribulations he faced during his time as President. There were multiple informational plaques out for display, many of them quite text heavy, that went into detail about Hardings upbringing and roots as the owner of a newspaper company in Marion. The plaques also talked about election day, and several of the policy’s Harding implemented while in office. The last section of the museum dealt with his death and some controversial issues that surrounded his presidency. There were multiple artifacts out for display in the museum, along with short video clips that related to President Harding's time in office.  Tip: I recommend spending 3 hours here if you truly want to see everything.|en|https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g50609-d103249-r989351848-Reviews-Warren_G_Harding_Presidential_Sites-Marion_Ohio.html?m=66827#review989351848|PartyTheNightAway|Solo travel|2024-07-31|

The house is stunning and is 90+ percent original from years ago when Warren and his wife Florence lived in the house.  The tour guides can answer any questions you have off the top of their heads.  The  Library & Museum was finished in the spring of 2021 and they have a nice gift shop in there too.  They spared no expense in the construction of the building - it is beautiful!!!!

As well it’s a nice enough establishment in a very nice location  I came with a party 8 so I did get to see and taste several dishes, nothing special, a few less than special. But it’s fine if you are just having a night out. My issue was with the service, or lack of service or caring  My wife ordered the salmon, she specifically asked on how it would be served, as she did not want the quinoa for dietary reasons. Our waitress came back to our table to verify that the salmon would not be served with the quinoa. About a half hour later our dishes all came out, with the quinoa under the salmon. Mistakes happen, so it should have been no problem to correct. Our waitress took the plate back saying a new plate will be made. At that point the restaurant lack of service and caring showed. First no one from management came to our table to just say sorry for the mistake, and it's being corrected. Second while all 7 people were eating our dinner, no manager cared enough to ask if there was a problem that my wife had no food in front of her. Then the final insult to an already dismal dining experience my wife's salmon never came back to our table. All 7 of our friends and family finished our meals. At that point the waitress said oh she can make it to go, as even then it did not come out from the kitchen.  If you wonder what the manager told us at that time, after the waitress verified the dish would be served as requested, got sent back, never to be served again.  We will never know as no manager ever came|en|https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g60805-d1749704-r982960548-Reviews-Taverna-Jacksonville_Florida.html?m=66827#review982960548|294iram|Friends getaway|2024-11-30|1

The service was good with a great choice of Asian cuisine and beers. The first time I had the spicy chicken bites for $10 followed by the duck curry at $22. The curry was just right in terms of heat though I would have preferred the duck to be trimmed. The second time I had the summer rolls (4) at $9 which were enough for two people followed by the Sea of Indochine - prawns, squid, etc. The squid was a bit chewy but otherwise it was delicious. Beers I had were Singha (bottled, $5 each) and Sapporo (draft, $6). A very enjoyable meal in warm surroundings.

We picked this place as it was  near a function  we attended earlier. The vibe was pretty cool and had a pleasant look. I haven’t been downtown as they roll the sidewalks up at 5 PM so I was surprised to see folks in here on a weekend… but only 2 other tables. Service was efficient and fast. Appetizers and food came out very fast. The chicken cashew was delicious, although cashews were missing from my dish and our friend got 2. If you name it cashew chicken , it better have cashews. When we mentioned this to the server he shared he had heard that complaint MANY times before. Very unsettling that no one bothers to fix a recurring issue!!A friend got pad Thai , which was flavorful and on point. Another friend got Kafir chicken which was very similar to General Tso’s chicken. Nice portions  all around and reasonably priced. The restaurant was stifling hot however as the AC didn’t work . I was appalled to hear it has been for over a DECADE according to the server. If you don’t care about your guests comfort or your staff I CANNOT recommend.  Yes they had fans but if you’re too cheap to afford an essential comfort, we will go elsewhere. It’s a shame as our guests enjoyed food. Blue Orchud  has ice cold AC and Al fresco dining! .. no contest!|en|https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g60805-d2326136-r967896387-Reviews-Indochine-Jacksonville_Florida.html?m=66827#review967896387|daivs|Couples|2024-09-30|

My|Excellent experience.  My girlfriend and I were visiting for business and stayed at the hotel next to Whiskey Jax.  She called ahead to make a reservation to eat and listen to the live band.  When we arrived they were packed. The manager, Joe, apologized for not having a table but he went above and beyond to find unoccupied bar stools and helped make space for us to wait at the bar while he waited for a table to open up.  We started with one stool, he then held two when two patrons paid their bill.  Shortly thereafter ha came over, bought us a round and said he now had a table.  We decided to hang with a terrific crowd at the bar.  Everyone was incredibly friendly and accommodating.    We then enjoyed a great country rock band.  I ordered ribs and shrimp.  The food came right out and was spectacular.  I’ll definitely come back. Thanks to manager Joe for being a professional host.  That’s a great way to create repeat customers in a business.

We booked through Resy, checked in, and were seated right away. Our waiter seemed new, but he was polite, tried hard, and kept things moving. We’re not high-maintenance, so no issues there.  We would rate the atmosphere as chill, not too lively but also not so quiet that it feels like you are at a library, you can actually talk without yelling across the table. The menu is on an iPad, and while the first one they handed us was dead, it was swapped out quickly.  For food, we ordered the burrata plate as an appetizer and the burger and the New York strip as dinner. The fresh burrata, with the heirloom tomatoes, pesto sauce and that bread was a great start and we knew we were not going to be disappointed with dinner. My significant other said the burger and onion rings were top notch. My steak came out a bit more cooked than I asked for, but after the first bite, I stopped caring. It was that good. The risotto was rich and creamy, and the steak portion size was way bigger than I expected from the menu photo (like significantly bigger).  Overall, it’s a solid place for dinner at a fair price. You’d probably spend about the same at a chain restaurant, but here you get real flavor, a nicer atmosphere, and a meal worth writing a TripAdvisor review for.|en|https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g60805-d13173196-r1034850222-Reviews-River_Post-Jacksonville_Florida.html?m=66827#review1034850222|bernardom864|Couples|2025-10-31|

Fried shrimp order Cajun.  It was FANTASTIC.  Very lightly breaded.  Very lightly fried.  All the flavors and textures that come from frying something but not all the grease and batter that hides the actual shrimp.  I do not remember the last time I had fried shrimp.  It doesn’t even appeal to me.  I was the one that got the chowder.  But, when family flies into JAX next year for our annual beach trip, I will be going to Chowder Ted’s and buying several pounds of fried shrimp for all.

It was very obvious that the vast majority of the folks inside were locals. My wife had fried shrimp - about a dozen large shrimp with a very light coating of batter. Excellent! I wanted something not fried and opted for the full pot of the chowder. Also excellent! They say it’s made fresh daily, and it was. A medium sized pan filled with a tomato based, thick soup with fresh potatoes, celery and large chunks of tuna and diced shrimp. Highly recommend.

Id had it a few weeks ago at J Alexander in Atlanta and it was more hearty and thicker. Just a preference.   The French Dip was my entree, it was not great.  Bread was borderline stale and the roast beef was loaded with gristle and fat.  I only ate half.

Furthermore, if you’d love to be contradicted by a waiter in a most rude manner, this might also be perfect for you. The food was fine, small portions, big prices, but tapas restaurants seem to be like that anyway. That is not the point. When I asked for pulpo asado (octopus) they brought fried breaded calamari. Even an elementary school kid the difference between squid and octopus. The extremely rude waiter contradicted me when I mentioned that this was not octopus, it was calamari. Octopi do not have rings!! Squid have rings and octopi have tentacles with suction cups. It was so obvious to the point of pathetic that it was funny how the man was dead set on contradicting us and in the most rude fashion. If I were the manager, which we did not contact because we didn’t want to make a scene, this guy would have been in the street right away.

They recommended that he and I meet at ""The Observatory"" on SE Stark Street. It is a small place, not at all noisy as I recall. I looked that the menu before I left to drive down to Portland. We got a booth by the front door, but it wasn't chilly (fall weather these days). My friend had an Elk Burger with cajin fries and an IPA beer. I had a Ruben sandwich with plain fries. Since I was driving home after lunch I stuck with water. I was quite pleased with my lunch, and the fries were the best fries that I have had in a long, long time. My friend praised the IPA on the first sip. He too liked his burger and fries.   We got there around 11:30 AM, and by noon all of the seating was occupied. The service was really great! There was not any kind of excess noise problem. I imagine some rowdy folks would come in from time to time, but the atmosphere was very nice during our visit.   Before we finished eating there was a small crowd gathered outside the door, waiting to get in. There was a crowd still there when we left. The servers didn't try to encourage us to leave, we left when we were ready."|en|https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g52024-d2213555-r1039431790-Reviews-The_Observatory-Portland_Oregon.html?m=66827#review1039431790|ldldjr|Friends getaway|2025-11-30|

The salad had lots of fresh ingredients: new potatoes, crunchy green beans, roasted red pepper and lightly smoked trout but the olive dressing was a bit plain, not much taste.

I’ve been here several times & never been disappointed. This time was different unfortunately. My first red flag was when our food came out in less than ten minutes. Fresh food takes longer than that to cook. My partner & I came by for dinner because she wanted the trout salad. Which she seemed to enjoy.  I was in the mood for white fish so I ordered the pan fried Idaho trout piccata, with broccolini & lemon mushroom risotto.  Sadly, the menu said nothing about the trout actually being farm raised steelhead (I hate steelhead) so that was my first disappointment.  Next, the risotto was complete mush. I asked the server to ask the kitchen when it was made. He said it was “prepped” yesterday. Having spent 20! Years in the culinary industry including culinary school I know what that means.   @ lastly, the broccoli was just unseasoned broccoli. Zero salt, pepper, or butter. The server was friendly enough & not rude at all, but when I made my disappointment visually & audibly known, he showed & offered zero in the way of fixing the situation. I did say that will take the remaining 2/3rds of the disappointing meal to go partner would have it at work later,  so I understand that. I despise people who complain just to get free stuff & so that’s why I try not to leave bad feedback.  I think the biggest disappointment was that from my very first sign of displeasure, there was no offer to fix the situation from beginning to end.  I left the couple stars because the staff were fine.

I am a pretty picky eater and more of a traditionalist in terms of my food.  Last time I was a little more experimental but this time I did the cheeseburger (a new add to their menu) and frittes.  We also did the grilled little gems (a lettuce).  That burger was amazing!  It's not big and not loaded with stuff on top.  But it's the right size to allow you to sample other things and is one of my top favorite burgers in town!  The frittes are crisp, thin, salty - perfect.  The gems were very good.  My husband had the Culottes which was excellent.  He also had the trout which he said was great (I'm not a fish person).    The previous trip we tried dessert and were not impressed.  Nothing enticed this time either.  But I see online they have a strawberry dish and considering and hoping they may use hood strawberries it may be worth trying!

Burger on lettuce with white cheddar, onion jam and avacado was excellent!   Consistently exceed expectations, not the usual run of the mill options so we always feel happily surprised, and you can't beat the great atmosphere and service.   This is a great first date place, casual dinner, group of friends or special event (smallish groups) location.  They fall somewhere between the cheap eats and the mid range.

Let’s start with the service our server made our experience very unique to us, understanding my personal dietary restrictions and explaining the restaurant and it’s entirety to us and the culture how the food works and is intended to be eaten (that being shared of personal meals).   Now let’s talk about the food. The food itself felt like comfort all while still remaining sophisticated. It was extremely well portioned for you to be able to experience from starter meals to the actual entrées all the way to dessert. The best way to describe the food experience I had was the comfort of going to eat at my Nina’s and being served my favorite meal but at an elevated experience with great drinks and service.   One thing I normally don’t review is atmosphere because I love hole in the walls, but the atmosphere of the restaurant itself was organized without feeling so modern and also very busy while also feeling very warm and that says quite a bit, considering that we sat at the communal counter, which you would imagine would feel like like a very individualized experience, yet, it was! I felt as though I was in my own bubble and loved seeing what others were ordering (I’m nosey like that). So don’t shy away from the chef’s counter if you can’t get your own table.

Exceeded expectations. The restaurant is beautiful - bright, modern and warm at the same time. We made a reservation at the communal table which really is just a series of tables set closely together. Other restaurants wouldn’t even call it communal, was more private than expected. The menu is filled with delicious options, hard to choose! We went with the plantain brioche buns with a seasoned butter- so tasty; peanut creamed greens - a fav, spicy and rich; griyo twice cooked pork - National dish of Haiti that bursts with color and flavor (avocado, slaw, fried plantains included); and whole tai snapper - tender with a beautifully spiced sauce and not a bone in sight except down the middle to hold together. The fish is good to share for two. I also have to mention the an lo zero proof drink that was amazing, so refreshing with yellow pepper, ginger and pineapple. Best non alcoholic drink I’ve had. To finish it off we loved the baked Haiti dessert, a coconut sponge cake covered in charred meringue and stuffed with cream and pineapple. So good. The guava sticky toffee pudding with ice cream was also a good choice. I’ve seen some other reviews that weren’t happy with the food, hard to understand unless you don’t like seasoned, flavorful food with a bit of spice. This is not typical dining, it’s better.   Service was attentive and friendly yet quick with the plates and the check. Understandable given a reservation is tough to get. Expensive as expected but completely worth it. Restaurant was packed on a Wednesday night in March. Even the bar seating was full.  Would love to return one day….|en|https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g52024-d25092895-r999956805-Reviews-Kann-Portland_Oregon.html?m=66827#review999956805|HBerke|Family|2025-03-31|

That was our experience at Kann.  Service by Chris and his team was impeccable.  Timing of plates was perfect, we were never rushed, the table was kept spotless, everyone was attentive without hovering.  The meal itself was fantastic.  We over ordered so we could try more dishes, and ended up taking a bunch home.  To be honest, I think i enjoyed the appetizers and sides as much as the main courses, but everything was spectacular.  I am gluten and dairy free due to allergies, and I was in heaven, knowing I could order just about anything on the menu and be safe.  Thank you!  We will make another reservation and wait our three months to get in - it was just a perfect, perfect meal in every way.

My wife and I stayed at the Crystal Hotel for her birthday and wanted a good steak for dinner. After researching through all of the ungodly expensive steakhouses in Portland we found Cassidy's and decided to give it a shot since it was a 5 minute walk away.  Walking in, the ambiance was great. The decor reminded me of a 40s or 50s era swanky restaurant with a gorgeous bar. The place is dimly lit with candles on the tables, which gave a very intimate feeling and was perfect for our date.  We went on a Friday night and it was just empty. I made us reservations expecting a busy restaurant and it wasn't necessary and totally surprising with how good this meal was. Like I said, total hidden gem in downtown Portland.   I'm vegan and my wife isn't so she NEVER gets a good steak anymore. She loves salad too so she ordered the Grilled Flank Steak Salad. Perfectly cooked and seasoned small piedmontese sirloin, organic greens, smoked blue cheese, pickled red onion, pear, candied hazelnuts with a blood orange truffle vinaigrette. She loved every bite!  The only mistake of the evening was she asked for no blue cheese and when she got the salad it was loaded with it. We sent it back and our server replaced it ASAP. However, they sent back the same steak that she originally got instead of remaking the entire dish. A little off-putting, but the steak was so good my wife loved it even when it was cold.   That series of mistakes would normally have taken away the 5th star but.....the heavens rejoiced when the chef created that Vegan Risotto!  The dish is arborio with roasted turnip, parsnip, and rutabaga, caramelized pear on top, and a vegan cashew brie stirred in.   I've always wanted to try risotto, but with my dietary restrictions I can't have cheese and dairy. I was super excited to see this on the menu for vegans and every bite was divine!! Creamy and cheesy, the rice was perfectly cooked and those roasted veggies were soooooooo good!!! I'll be honest, I wasn't sure what to think about the caramelized pear on top (I'm not usually a sweet dinner kind of guy) but the bite all together was complex rollercoaster of flavor that I never wanted to end. I was truly sad that the meal was gone and I couldn't have seconds!  We ended the night with a creme brule dessert that the server comped us for the salad mistake. It was an orange citrus creme brule and my wife enjoyed every last bite.  My only real critique and thing I felt lacking was there wasn't a dessert option for a vegan even though there is a vegan dish on the menu. I had to sit and watch my wife eat dessert while I sipped on my water. Even if it was just a light sorbet with some mint for a pallet cleanser, a vegan friendly dessert to wrap up the awesome vegan meal would be super appreciated.   Our server. I feel bad because I didn't get his name but he was a trooper! He was the host, the server AND the bartender. There was some other staff for sure, but the guy working the evening shift on 12/09/22 behind the bar deserves a raise!  We'll definitely be back next time we're in Portland!!!  #kudostothechef|en|https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g52024-d439883-r871820117-Reviews-Cassidy_s_Restaurant-Portland_Oregon.html?m=66827#review871820117|tinytrailernomad|Couples|2022-12-31|1

The descriptions for the raviolis sounded amazing with the ingredients of beef, ricotta and honey.   I detected no ricotta or honey and all we received were 4 squares of ravioli for $26!

Upon walking in, we were greeted very warmly with smiles. We were immediately seated. The waitress was very pleasant. I can't remember her name, but she was young with blonde hair and a facial piercing. She provided her recommendations by request. It took us a min to figure out what we wanted, but she was very patient.  We ordered the BBQ fried rice and boneless chicken thighs. It all came out hot and tasty. For dunks, we ordered Makers Mark whiskey with coke ave cherries and a tequila well drink. Both were delicious. We spoke to our waitress about how our time has been in Portland. She was very friendly. We ended the night with a special boozy slushy shot that she had made for my wife to help celebrate her bday. She put a candle in it and all. We loved that gesture!!!!

We've enjoyed a number of tasting menus, so we were excited to try this one.  In the end, I felt it was pretty expensive for the overall experience. I wish I'd read the reviews more carefully before booking  Pros:  We all really enjoyed the food!  The serving sizes were perfect so we didn't feel stuffed by the 4th course.  The courses were all quite different & pleasing.  We all loved having 3 dessert courses (that might not be the case for everyone).  The staff was friendly & seemed to enjoy what they're doing. The wine pairings were nice with mostly regional producers (we had 2 pairings for 4 of us).   I received an email asking about food allergies two days before the reservation, which was nice.   If you enjoy watching the cooks in the kitchen, this would be a great choice - you are literally in the kitchen.  Cons:  We arrived rather dressed up for a special night out - shouldn't have bothered.  The ambiance is like having dinner with a bunch of strangers in someone's not so fancy garage.  I would have been happier & far more comfortable in a pair of jeans & a sweatshirt (like the guy next to me).  The communal table is very wide, so talking to our friends across the table was not great.  Considering we'd flown in for the day to have dinner with our friends, this was disappointing. I'd had prepaid for the dinner when I made the reservation but when we arrived there was a note saying that the tip was not included.|en|https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g52024-d8511397-r728016791-Reviews-Nomad_PDX-Portland_Oregon.html?m=66827#review728016791|AnnieR303|NONE|2019-11-30|

A number of different options presented themselves, and Nomad PDX kept popping up as a place we should take a look at. We decided to go with it and were, obviously, very happy with our decision!  The police is located in a pretty nondescript building that has some really cool space contained within it. You walk in and there's a very casual sitting area with tons of exposed brick, some fun lighting and some very modern looking Decour. It's an interesting mix of classic and modern styles.In doing so, they create a really nice area for people to come in and wind down. The adjacent bar is very cozy, and the dining area - which is literally a long table Just outside the kitchen - creates a very intimate dining experience and atmosphere.  This place apparently started as a pop-up restaurant they got so popular that they decided to open a standalone restaurant. Ryan Fox, the head chef, is doing some really cool stuff here!  There wasn't really a theme to the dinner, other than being delicious.There were a total of eight courses, all of which showed a lot of creativity as well as consideration of the patrons... Mostly because they had three dessert courses!  The variety of foods was pretty awesome, and range from a Peruvian inspired ceviche, to a trout collar serve with flatbread and different butters, to a celery root foam and desserts that included the use of liquid nitrogen (food science is fun!) The trout collar was an absolute hit, as it showcased a really nice portion of the fish that a lot of people don't often pay attention to. Another big hit was a squash soup served with pumpkin bread and chestnut butter. It ends up chestnut butter is awesome!  The favorite dessert was also the signature one. They call it the nest egg, and it is beautiful! Trying to describe and greens does not do this thing justice, but let it be known that this is one of the more beautiful and delicious desserts we've ever experienced!  The measure of a great meal isn’t only the food, but arguably more the entire experience- At the end of the night, we walked away knowing a new group of people who are also big fans of food, and having had a meal that we won't soon forget. If you have an opportunity to go dine at this place, you should absolutely take advantage of it!|en|https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g52024-d8511397-r726297523-Reviews-Nomad_PDX-Portland_Oregon.html?m=66827#review726297523|TheUhlmen|Couples|2019-11-30|

Tasting menu served at communal tables of about 15-16 guests. The 6:00 PM seating was almost full but some dinners were late, as late as 30 minutes past the hour and the on-time guests had to sit and wait, kind of unfair to the on-time guests. No complimentary drinks or apologies were offered. Kind of unwise. Food is generally good, but mainly a few slices of peaches, grapes etc mixed with various cream and sauces. Nothing particularly innovative. The best item was the mushroom stuffed with chicken; the other protein dish, halibut was pretty soupy and uninspiring. More expensive than comparable establishments offering tasting menu in   the neighborhood.|en|https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g52024-d8511397-r699760609-Reviews-Nomad_PDX-Portland_Oregon.html?m=66827#review699760609|Adtravel75|NONE|2019-08-31|2

The reception staff (including Tania) were absolutely delightful and very helpful. The apt itself was a one bedroom on the ground floor. It was quite spacious for the two of us and had a patio/sitting area out back looking out on the garden.  The WiFi signal was good, the TV only had one English Channel (news). Never-ending hot water and great water pressure in the shower. The kitchen was nicely stocked - even w sponge and dish soap!   All 3 floors of the apt can use the rooftop terrace, which allows you to see the sunset - or just walk to the cliffs/beach trail.   We didn't use the nice pool (free) or other (paid) amenities like mini-golf, tennis, etc.   We really enjoyed the location and the apt!|en|https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1190875-d1193745-r266631169-Reviews-Dunas_Park_Beach_Club-Manta_Rota_Faro_District_Algarve.html?m=66827#review266631169|preisner|Couples|2015-04-30|1

Check in was ok. Room was ok with a kitchenette. Some cultery within the drawers needed clean, we didn't use them, Bought plastic forks from local shop. The pool area is lovely, although very busy in the evenings, i think they allow locals to use the pool, hard to find an empty sun lounger. The hotel is pretty much located next to the beach, which was nice if you wanted a change from the noise of the pool area. We didn't eat at the hotel, either ate out or made our own food in room.   Manta Rota is a very very quiet area in the algarve. Manta Rota is also a very small, quiet area. Not much to do. We spent most of our time further up the road in Monte Gordio, it's more liver with better selection of restaurants to choose from. Manta Rota is fine if your looking to sit and read a book all week. It was not the place that was sold to us, we were in mid tewnties, averge age was about 60 years!|en|https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1190875-d1193745-r119040306-Reviews-Dunas_Park_Beach_Club-Manta_Rota_Faro_District_Algarve.html?m=66827#review119040306|icyclebelfast|Couples|2010-11-30|1

The decor is very “Dallas” if that makes sense to you. We reserved a table in the climate-controlled patio, which was a great choice. You get the city views while inside the cozy restaurant. Our server Pernod (forgive me if I’m butchering his name) was great, very attentive. And I can’t forget the pretty hostess that offered to take our picture (I didn’t get her name but we were there 10/27/25 if that helps and she wore black leather leggings and a red/black/tan flannel shirt, with longish black hair).  The food was amazing! I got the ribeye with tallow fries and my husband had the ribs with mac & cheese and cornbread. When I say all of it was good, I mean EVERYTHING was cooked just right-the steak was juicy and flavorful, the fries were hot with the right crisp balance, mac & cheese was creamy and seasoned, and the ribs were perfection! And the cornbread…I’m not even big on sweet cornbread but this here tasted like something from a deep south granny’s kitchen! I also had a classic margarita that was very well made, not too sweet or overwhelming. If you’re in the area, please check them out-great choice for date night.

The hostess seemed to be preoccupied and somewhat detached from greeting customers. The restaurant was maybe 30% capacity.  Slow Sunday around 1:30. The hostess tried to seat us at a tiny 2 top table on the patio. Our res was not for the patio. We asked if we could sit inside, and she hesitantly said ""yes"" and told us to have a seat and wait.....After waiting 10 minutes she took us past 6 open booths and 4 tables to sit us directly between two parties at another 2 top table.   We sat there for 7-8 minutes without being greeted by a server and decided to sit at the bar. When asked about all of the open booths and tables and we were told they were ""reserved and for 4 or more guests"".  We ordered two drinks at the bar and were handed menus.  The bartender was doing inventory and the service bartender stayed busy.   We had to flag down the bartender to order food after waiting 35 minutes.  The food was average.  My chicken was half breaded and the gravy was nonexistent which made eating it with the large biscuit dry and difficult. While sitting at the bar we noticed several of the booths were being sat with parties of 2. Upon leaving many of the tables and booths remained unoccupied.  The next time we Brunch in Dallas, this won't be high on our list.  The experience starts with the first face you see."|en|https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g55711-d23538916-r985279450-Reviews-Haywire-Dallas_Texas.html?m=66827#review985279450|bradv555|Friends getaway|2024-12-31|

The server (Perry) did a great job.   The orkra special appetizer was certainly plentiful, hot, and  fresh however the dressing (Madras curry buttermilk ranch dressing)   ""dip"" lacked any hint of curry. The Porcini Pappardella Pasta was short on meat sauce unlike previous times my wife enjoyed that entrée.  The special seared dbl bone-in Heritage pork chop would have been great had it not been swimming in jus....the broth simply dissolved the polenta, wiped out the flavor of any apple chutney and soaked away the otherwise enjoyment of any distinct flavor of the ""char"" on the chop.  On the positive side was an outstanding Sticky Toffee Pudding.    Wish the overall meal could have been better as all the meals had been in the past.  Price was right at $140 for the two of us but considering all the restaurant choices available there really is no reason to go back."|en|https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g55711-d493458-r766464913-Reviews-Suze-Dallas_Texas.html?m=66827#review766464913|103gregc|NONE|2020-08-31|

We used to go to Suze, when it was BYOB, at least 3 times per month ... pretty much almost every Friday.  We always requested and sat at the same table, and we always had the same server.  I think we ate there at least 50 times.  Interestingly, we met the owner and chef Gilbert during all of those visits just twice.  He wouldn’t recognize us if we were standing right in front of him.  Since Suze reopened in the new location, and opened a full bar, thus eliminating the BYOB option, we have only been back twice.  One of our favorite things to get on the old menu was their fantastic cheese plate.  But the last time we visited, that had been taken off the menu.  I guess when you get rid of the BYOB crowd, there is much less demand for cheese plates.  The rest of the menu seems pretty much unchanged, other than whatever the nightly special is.  Maybe the pastas are a little different.  Maybe a few more changes would be a good idea.  The argument that the loyal old crowd wants the same things may not be valid, my impression is that the crowd has changed.  The BYOB people were the foundation of the business, I remember seeing the majority of patrons arrive with their own personal wine bottle carriers.  That isn’t happening any more.  On one of our last visits, I won’t go into specifics, but my entree was inedible.  I took one bite and left the entire thing, and our server just picked it up and didn’t even bother to ask why I had not eaten any of it.  I didn’t want to bring it up myself or ask for something else, I just wanted to leave.    Despite these issues which have affected our interest in dining at Suze, I recently went online to opentable to make a reservation and was surprised to see that they no longer use opentable as a reservation service.  So I called the restaurant to make a reservation a week in advance, and got an answering machine.  I left a message with my call back number, and nobody ever called me back.    It’s a shame, but I imagine they are not doing very well if my recent experiences are representative of how things are handled these days.  But I wish them the best.  We have a lot of memories there.|en|https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g55711-d493458-r686647836-Reviews-Suze-Dallas_Texas.html?m=66827#review686647836|TheLearnedDoctor|Couples|2019-06-30|1

We opened the restaurant for brunch with 10 ladies at 10:30 AM. Started off good and liked the waiter. We were celebrating an engagement. The bride to be didn’t get her food until 35-40 minutes after the rest of the party. We were seriously done eating and she still didn’t have her food. She ordered chicken & waffles and at first they stated that the chef didn’t like how her waffle turned out so the kitchen was remaking it - fine, right? - but then the chicken supposedly burned while the waffle was being remade. They brought out a mini plate of salad and 1/2 portion of salmon benedict with caviar which went to waste because our friend doesn’t like salmon or caviar. Her food finally came out and then we were told they were preparing a special dessert to make up for the mishaps and delivered out spoons to all. We waited another 15 minutes just to have two SMALL plates of sorbet delivered out to share. I was like, “That’s what we were waiting on?“ Geez. The waiter apologized for everything and said that they took some items off the bill, but they only adjusted the bill for the chicken and waffles. The manager was so disengaged throughout this whole 3 hour brunch. Good Lord! She acted indifferent. If I had been in charge, I would’ve asked the person if they wanted something else from the menu as clearly there was something going on in the kitchen behind the scenes. I also would have sent a round of champagne out to the group and took off not only the chicken and waffle entree but the two plates of shared scones. Cute place but probably won’t be back. Service is way too important to me. Food was good overall but not enough to make up for a bad manager and the terrible amount of time we waited for one thing or another.|en|https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g55711-d19764418-r934068406-Reviews-Georgie_by_Curtis_Stone-Dallas_Texas.html?m=66827#review934068406|rebeccabN6585AN|Friends getaway|2024-01-31|

The place is cool in appearance, stone building, nice outside patio!  The appeal is nostalgia… not good quality food IMHO.    The table ordered soup, fried chicken, fried catfish, baked chicken, grilled salmon, and a handful of sides.  The lentil soup was very good, but everything else was just OK!  None of the food was particularly hot, and with fried food, it’s gotta be hot!  The veggie sides were warm at best… seemed most of the food was cooked in advance, which allowed for speedy delivery, but quality suffered.

It’s worth a stop if you’re visiting from out of town and looking for a family friendly, reasonably priced, unique dining experience. Celebration has been a local favorite for years, and we love trying the specials as well as eating from their standard menu. Their salads are always  fresh, the tea is strong and fresh brewed, and there is a good selection of entrees providing choices for everyone. The restaurant itself is quaint with photos on the walls depicting various stages of their history. There a little mini dining rooms with several booths and tables as they have had several space add-ons over the years. Definitely recommend stopping here if you haven’t already!|en|https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g55711-d465073-r966757274-Reviews-Celebration-Dallas_Texas.html?m=66827#review966757274|brookegoesplaces|Family|2024-08-31|

Steak was amazing, and the staff gave me a surprise dessert when I told them I was celebrating a milestone accomplishment with work.

Valet was easy. The hosting staff was amazing and gave us recommendations and were super friendly. We waited about 15 minutes to be sat because she said she wanted us in the main dining room after we told her our monthly steakhouse review plans. Sweet girl. We talked with them almost the whole wait. The decor was cool, including a giant fish tank and car in the dining room. The atmosphere was loud and vibrant with a cool guy swagger. Our server was exceptional and made some suggestions as well. We ordered the filet mignon, cheeseburger and fries, (one of the recommendations by hostess), mac and cheese, fried brussel sprouts, and passion fruit kickers. Okay, so they cook their steaks over some cedar wood and I just wasn't the biggest fan as it tasted smokey and almost bbq'd and I guess I'm a bit of a traditionalist when it comes to steak. It was cooked perfectly but I had a hard time getting past the woodsy flavor. The voodoo sauce they served with it was SLAPPIN. Request it if you go. They told us the cheeseburger and fries were better than Hudson House. Nope, as it was really, really salty and you could feel the salt crystals in your mouth. The mac and cheese was okay but mine is better and the brussel sprouts were the star of the show with a tangy honey mustard flavor that we both looooved. We didn't do dessert, which is a travesty, but nothing really spoke to us. No tears overall (yes, I sometimes cry when i eat really good food). The meal was $150 and we left $60 for tip and $5 for valet for a total of $215. Food: 5/10 Ambience: 8/10 Service: 10/10 Next up is Pappas Brothers for anyone who cares, but I'm excited and this is fun.

The AC was broken on a day when temperatures soared over 100 degrees, making for an unbearably hot and uncomfortable dining experience. To make matters worse, the restaurant was plagued with flies everywhere. They placed a broken fly fan on our table that was not only ineffective but also a potential safety hazard.  The steak frites were mediocre at best—the meat was a terrible cut and lacked flavor. Service was incredibly slow; we had to wait over 10 minutes just to get a drink or water refill. It felt like we were completely forgotten. Overall, this place was a letdown in every possible way.

Layers of fluffy pancakes stuffed between with eggs, bacon, sausage gravy and syrup. It was so fun to eat off of these breakfast items in a pot pie style. The Chicken fried benedict was good.

The Library (aka Museum) is quite small compared to other presidential libraries, but does a good job telling the story of Harding's short presidency. Tours of his home are only offered on the hour, so we had to miss that, but did take photos from the outside. We also visited the Harding Memorial in the cemetery, which was quite impressive. If you're passing by Marion, Ohio, take a break from your drive and stop by to see the presidential sites.|en|https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g50609-d103249-r1035555428-Reviews-Warren_G_Harding_Presidential_Sites-Marion_Ohio.html?m=66827#review1035555428|lithlith|Couples|2025-10-31|

Harding Presidential Sites|Great trip. We arrived at approximately 9:30 am and made our way towards the entrance of the museum. After paying the admission fee, we received a quick overview of the site and went on our way. We opted to view some of the outdoor exhibits first, which included the guard house and press house. The press house contained multiple informational plaques about President Hardings wife and her contributions to society. After viewing the press house, we made our way to the front porch of the house, where we waited for the 10 am guided hour tour to begin. There were guided tours of the presidents former house being held every hour throughout the day. The guided tour of the house was very informational, and the tour guide took us from room to room, while pointing out interesting features and artifacts out for display. The tour guide told us several personal stories related to the Hardings time at the house. The guided tour lasted roughly 1 hour.  After viewing the house, we went back inside to view the main exhibits. We opted to watch a short documentary about President Hardings life and some of the trials and tribulations he faced during his time as President. There were multiple informational plaques out for display, many of them quite text heavy, that went into detail about Hardings upbringing and roots as the owner of a newspaper company in Marion. The plaques also talked about election day, and several of the policy’s Harding implemented while in office. The last section of the museum dealt with his death and some controversial issues that surrounded his presidency. There were multiple artifacts out for display in the museum, along with short video clips that related to President Harding's time in office.  Tip: I recommend spending 3 hours here if you truly want to see everything.|en|https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g50609-d103249-r989351848-Reviews-Warren_G_Harding_Presidential_Sites-Marion_Ohio.html?m=66827#review989351848|PartyTheNightAway|Solo travel|2024-07-31|

Never-ending hot water and great water pressure in the shower. The kitchen was nicely stocked - even w sponge and dish soap!   All 3 floors of the apt can use the rooftop terrace, which allows you to see the sunset - or just walk to the cliffs/beach trail.

Check in was ok. Room was ok with a kitchenette. Some cultery within the drawers needed clean, we didn't use them, Bought plastic forks from local shop. The pool area is lovely, although very busy in the evenings, i think they allow locals to use the pool, hard to find an empty sun lounger. The hotel is pretty much located next to the beach, which was nice if you wanted a change from the noise of the pool area. We didn't eat at the hotel, either ate out or made our own food in room.   Manta Rota is a very very quiet area in the algarve. Manta Rota is also a very small, quiet area. Not much to do. We spent most of our time further up the road in Monte Gordio, it's more liver with better selection of restaurants to choose from. Manta Rota is fine if your looking to sit and read a book all week.

The placement of each animal across from the Elk Refuge is so perfect and acts like a canvas in complimenting each sculpture. I especially loved “Great Northern” and “The Emperor” on the walk.

Stopped into Chowder Ted’s the night before.  Wanted somewhere local and it had good reviews.  Only got to go, 3 things.  Chowder which was pretty good.  Fried shrimp order plain.  Fried shrimp order Cajun.  It was FANTASTIC.  Very lightly breaded.  Very lightly fried.  All the flavors and textures that come from frying something but not all the grease and batter that hides the actual shrimp.  I do not remember the last time I had fried shrimp.  It doesn’t even appeal to me.  I was the one that got the chowder.  But, when family flies into JAX next year for our annual beach trip, I will be going to Chowder Ted’s and buying several pounds of fried shrimp for all.

It was very obvious that the vast majority of the folks inside were locals. My wife had fried shrimp - about a dozen large shrimp with a very light coating of batter. Excellent! I wanted something not fried and opted for the full pot of the chowder. Also excellent! They say it’s made fresh daily, and it was. A medium sized pan filled with a tomato based, thick soup with fresh potatoes, celery and large chunks of tuna and diced shrimp. Highly recommend.

She ordered veal and I ordered the scallop and pasta special.  Her veal and potatoes were very good but the ""vegetable medley"" was a pile of mushy vegs. The best thing that could be said about my dish were the two blistered cherry tomatoes were tasty.  The bead size scallops were rubbery, the small amt of sauce was incredibly bland, and the dish was dry. The side garden salads were very nice size, fresh and good.  The salted caramel cheesecake was amazing and strangely enough, the decaf coffee  was truly terrific.  However, a $97 meal (we ordered no alcohol) with mushy vegetables and a non-edible entree was a big disappointment.  The reason I did not send back my entree was that it took 45 minutes for our meal to arrive.  There were 3 servers and 9 tables, so that was not the issue."|en|https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g34422-d15141077-r940779021-Reviews-The_Salt_Block-Marianna_Florida.html?m=66827#review940779021|LadyPentel|Family|2024-03-31|1

Warning - Diner beware! The menu is exactly what you get, there are no options & there are no substitutions. Limited menu's are not a problem but I have found most restaurants offer at least a choice of vegetable & some bread & or side salad as part of the overall meal. Not this one. The night we were there, dinner came with garlic mashed potatoes & vegetable medley, no other options, no substitutions no exceptions. If you dislike something, like say, garlic or green beans too darned bad. I had the chicken Garcia, my partner had the 16 oz ribeye and a side salad, we both drank water. When the bill came we were shocked! Our meal came to almost $95! My chicken was $24, the side salad was $5, My partner's ribeye was $59!  Yes, it was listed as MP(Market Price), which means the price varies with the cost of the ingredients but really? I know the high price wasn't in the mashed potatoes or vegetable medley or my chicken dinner would have cost more so it must have been the steak.  It was tasty but it was not $59 worth of tasty. The staff, while friendly, were well versed in ""we don't do that here"".  We will not be going back."|en|https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g34422-d15141077-r924729069-Reviews-The_Salt_Block-Marianna_Florida.html?m=66827#review924729069|muirnemt|Couples|2023-10-31|

We were here on a Tuesday night to see the Cellar Boys, and it was wonderful! We were disappointed to have to share a table, especially given that it was the night of our 30th anniversary and we are both introverts, but I do get it - it is a small venue. I cannot say enough good things about the Cellar Boys - wow, they were awesome! Service at the club was not great. I went up to the bar to ask for water as I was parched, and two people were behind the bar watching the band. I am easy to miss being only five feet tall, so I waved to the lady and she headed my way and looked really angry. Alas, sorry but I really needed water badly, and my server had not been around in ages! I left a tip on the bar and hoped for better days for her.

The stopper for the tub was laying on the edge of the tub whether it worked at all, I don't know. There was a Q-tip on the floor in the closet. The bed had no full size pillows. It had 5 half size pillows. The TV was hit or miss. Some of the channels worked but they did not correspond to the guide sheet for the room. More channels did not work than did work, they came on but the picture was unviewable as if the signal was garbled. I will say, the host did all she could to give us a good room but I don't think she had one. I will never stay at that motel again. It is the worst room I have ever stayed in with Comfort Inns.

Room 200 had a leak in the ceiling with water dripping on floor and plaster falling from the season! While they are in the process of updating rooms on the first floor it still has major issues and not a Comfort Inn expectation. We also had someone outside our room in the parking lot from 9pm- 1am with car stereo playing loud and thumping while they smoked pot. No security and didn’t feel safe.

The kitchen’s intimate choreography—flame, fork, and ferocious curiosity—sets a high bar for tasting-menu storytelling.  This night, seated inches from the heat and bustle, offered a stream of inventive bites that balanced seasonal audacity with comforting textures and precise technique.  The setting amplifies the meal: you’re not just observing the plate, you’re watching how intention becomes taste in real time. The energy from the cooks, the quick taste checks, and the moment-to-moment adjustments lend the tasting a live, improvisational rhythm.  Fresh draft watermelon fresca: A refreshing opener that primes the palate with bright acidity and fruit-forward brightness. The texture contrast and cooling finish likely set a playful, summery tone for the night.  Texas pickles: Expect a bold, tangy punctuation—crisp texture, assertive acidity, and perhaps a touch of sweetness. Pickles here are not an afterthought but a defining bite that signals the kitchen’s love for zesty contrast.  Pork belly slider: A classic anchor that often serves as the night’s emotional anchor—rich, satisfying, and balanced by a crisp exterior and perhaps a sharp pickled accent or herb pop. The slider format promises immediacy and comfort while still leaving room for technique to show.  Cast iron cheddar cornbread: This likely delivers a toasty, caramelized crust with a rich, melty cheddar inside. The cast-iron finish usually adds depth and a slight smokiness, offering a grounded counterpoint to lighter courses.  Redfish ceviche: A bright, citrusy, seafood-forward note that showcases freshness and technique in curing. The ceviche should feel clean, with a nuanced balance of acidity and a touch of brightness to keep things lively.  Thai apple salad: A bright, aromatic interlude—crisp apples, maybe herbs, heat, and a balancing acidity. Expect a playful balance of sweet, sour, and fresh heat, lifting the meal with herbal lift.  Fettuccine shrimp: A pasta course that blends succulent shrimp with a likely buttered, perhaps slightly citrusy sauce. Textural contrast and a clean, seafood-forward core would anchor this plate in comfort while letting seafood flavor shine.  Blackened redfish with mesquite and vanilla bean scoop: This sounds like a bold, smoky main that leans into spice, wood-fire aroma, and a surprising vanilla note—an inventive sweet-smoky finish that creates a memorable, almost mischievous twist.  Final note—Mesquite vanilla bean scoop: Expect a creamy, aromatic end that complements the savory notes with a gentle sweetness, leaving you on a soft, satisfying close.  Odd Duck Austin, experienced from the chef’s counter, delivers a distinctive tasting experience that blends seasonal clarity with adventurous flavor experiments. It rewards diners who embrace curiosity and savor the storytelling arc of a well-curated menu. If you’re craving a night where the kitchen feels like a collaborative partner rather than a distant authority, this counter-seat experience is worth seeking out.|en|https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g30196-d6105656-r1038648416-Reviews-Odd_Duck-Austin_Texas.html?m=66827#review1038648416|Y8697ATheatherd|Friends getaway|2025-11-30|

With multiple themed areas scattered throughout you are sure to have a different “view” each time you visit. Our family of four was seated on “Garrisons” family porch overlooking the “courtyard” bar as dusk beamed through the surrounding “tree” foliage. Needless to say the theming of the entire space was on the level of a Broadway stage. The food here is absolutely delicious! Every dish we tried was bursting with flavor and cooked to perfection. The portions were appropriate and everyone left satisfied. I highly recommend the Pea Risotto and Prosciutto Pizza. The sourdough pizza base made my partner question their loyalty to our local pizza shop! The night was made complete with our amazing server Tugce. She was friendly, attentive, and went above and beyond to ensure a memorable dining experience.

Another good meal enjoyed recently...  the complimentary chips and salsa are da bomb!  Light crisp chips, and the salsa tastes like it just came out of the garden... super fresh ingredients!   We had a couple of the ""Lime in the Coconut"" cocktails, reminiscent of a pina colada, but better, and not too sweet.  Very good.  For food, we settled on the  pollo flautas (chicken flautas) and the fish tacos.  Both were very good, and the flautas were some of the best we've ever had.  The tacos were stuffed full of fish and fresh veggies.  We sat at the bar this visit, and the bartender was super-busy, so not much time to visit.  Recommend Verde's for good Tex-Mex in the Dripping Springs area."|en|https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g30196-d4046769-r930404065-Reviews-Verdes_Grill-Austin_Texas.html?m=66827#review930404065|jimnabholz|Family|2023-12-31|

We decided to dine at the bar, as the STL Cardinals game was just starting on the TV behind the bar!!!  Met Brandon working behind the bar, who turned out to be one of the owners, and originally from my home state of MO, and also a HUGE Cardinals fan!  His Cardinals baseball cap was a giveaway!  LOL   It felt like it was going to be a good night… and it was!    We started with complimentary chips and salsa, which was delicious​:  super crispy ​corn tortilla ​chips, lightly salted, and a very fresh, salsa with just the right amount of heat.   We ordered a couple of appetizers, the ceviche and the calabaza cakes.  The ceviche was super fresh, and the fried flour tortilla chips served alongside made a good pairing.  The liquid wasabi ​drizzled beneath the chips was a bit of a surprise, but​, alongside the mango drizzle, it was good.  The calabaza cakes are spaghetti squash and stewed chicken atop a poblano cream sauce.  A tasty and delicious combination, and the cream sauce was sublime!  For entrees, we enjoyed ​t​he fish tacos and shrimp ​​mojo dishes. The ingredients in both dishes were super fresh, freshly prepared, and seasonings were on point.  Simply put, both entrées were outstanding!  We tried several margaritas during​ ​our meal, and we would have to say that the Skinny Holly was our favorite.  We were too full to even think about dessert, so we will have to save that for next time.  Ending the evening on an incredibly high note, Brandon allowed us to take an empty bottle of one of our favorite tequilas served at the restaurant, Clase Azul Reposado.  Excellent tequila, in a hand-painted pottery bottle.  I can also vouch for the Verde’s grilling seasoning sold at the bar. ​ I used it the following night at home, and it is outstanding…​  Great people, great food!  A bit pricey, but not bad.   We’ll definitely be back!!!  I do need to apologize for some of the photos included with this review​; as noted above, there was a ​Cardinals' ​baseball game on​,​ so I did not get pictures of some of the dishes until they were partially eaten!

You will want to look up the quotes online.   We went for a weekend lunch and got a table quickly.   The service is prompt and the chips and salsa was good with the a nice heat to the salsa.   We ordered a couple dishes.  One of the dishes was switched with another diner so it had bacon in it.  The wait staff recognized on their own that they had made an error and apologized profusely and offered to it right by bringing out the dish made without the bacon.  It is rare to have that caring and hospitality any more in casual dining.   I was super impressed and would recommend this restaurant without hesitation.  The food itself was very good.

We had real looked forward to a very special, upscale, what a big disappointment. First although they said they had a dress code all staff were in jeans. I guess it was supposed to be eclectic but the interior seemed very tired. We wanted to try one of the menu items we saw online but all the menu was the same as the price fixed,but was restaurant week and the entree we wanted was not listed. To start they offered a  half glass of sparkling wine which we declined. My husband asked for Pinot Grigio but they didn't have it. I ordered a blonde in lilet and it arrived, not in the customary highball glass with a slice of orange but in a champagne glass with a slice of lemon. New to me. The crab fingers were good. The squash salad was too spicy and oily for me . The main course tritip  steak they charge $51 for on the menu  was so  tough! The sauce was delicious. The dessert of peaches and sort of a yogurt was overpowered by the mint. Needless to say that 9over $200 dinner could not hold a candle to the many restaurants we have been to in the last month.|en|https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g30196-d3156921-r1027693117-Reviews-Lenoir-Austin_Texas.html?m=66827#review1027693117|Texastravelers94|Couples|2025-08-31|

Whoever cooked the steak had to have worked in a steakhouse, it was perfectly cooked, perfectly sauced and came out hot. The “best selling” bread with pimento cheese was deconstructed with pimento in one pile and cheese in another. Guys really? We ordered the crudo which was sauced well but the fish was bland. The noodle dish which was so embarrassingly small, luke warm and brown. This your best offering for a vegetarian dish at $14? We sent it back.

The restaurant was completely empty on Saturday afternoon when a group of around 15 high school athletes came in for post tournament meal. He was rude to them and made them stand outside in the cold and rain while he got a table ready. There was plenty of room for them to stand out of the way inside the restaurant.

We were not disappointed!  Frog and the Bull is a modest sized place in a strip mall, nice vibe, folks having a good time at the bar.  Destiny was our waitress, she did a great job, attentive but not intrusive.  Thanks Destiny!  We started the meal with the brussels sprouts on the recommendation of Destiny.  What a winner that dish is!  Sprouts, apples, Manchego cheese, sherry vinegarette reduction and some awesome bacon bits... heaven on a plate!   For entrees, we opted for the pepper-crusted filet, medium rare, and the fish and chips.  Both plates were good.  The filet was cooked perfectly, spot on temperature, and the pepper-crust was a bit overpowering.  Not bad, interesting.  We're more purists when it comes to meat, so the filet itself would likely have been even more delicious.  The sides of asparagus and pasta were okay, a Basque-style potato on the side would have outshined the pasta.    The fish and chips were good.  The fish was fresh, nice batter, served piping hot as it should be.  The fish portion was modest, especially given the price tag.  At that price point ($25), the fish serving should have been twice the size.  The initial serving of ""chips"" were room temperature at best, but that was quickly remedied by Destiny when brought to her attention.  The truffle fries are darn good when hot!  All in all, a good meal.  A 4-star experience.  The above observations are intended to suggest options for improvements, not criticize.  The ""Frog"" portion of the restaurant's name is an homage by the owner (a former Navy Seal) to his fallen Navy brethren.  (Note the Navy Seal Trident above the entrance to the kitchen).  Thank you for your service!  We will be back, lots of other stuff to try on the menu.  Recommend Frog and the Bull, nice vibe, good food."|en|https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g30196-d20186695-r938045943-Reviews-Frog_The_Bull-Austin_Texas.html?m=66827#review938045943|jimnabholz|Family|2024-02-29|

Thanks Anthony!  Food at this restaurant was well prepared, very tasty, and portion size was satisfying. We started with the grilled artichokes which we had had before and they are fantastic, with a nice aïoli dip. My wife had a vegetable plate and a crab cake. She makes a great crab cake, but admitted that this crab cake may have been better than hers. All crab, no filling. Outstanding! I had a marinated ribeye and baked potato. Both were delicious. Both of us had enough food that we brought home leftovers which I enjoyed for lunch.   Had a latte for dessert which was an exceptionally good cup of coffee, and the Key lime pie was memorable.

Tours of his home are only offered on the hour, so we had to miss that, but did take photos from the outside. We also visited the Harding Memorial in the cemetery, which was quite impressive.

Harding Presidential Sites|Great trip. We arrived at approximately 9:30 am and made our way towards the entrance of the museum. After paying the admission fee, we received a quick overview of the site and went on our way. We opted to view some of the outdoor exhibits first, which included the guard house and press house. The press house contained multiple informational plaques about President Hardings wife and her contributions to society. After viewing the press house, we made our way to the front porch of the house, where we waited for the 10 am guided hour tour to begin. There were guided tours of the presidents former house being held every hour throughout the day. The guided tour of the house was very informational, and the tour guide took us from room to room, while pointing out interesting features and artifacts out for display. The tour guide told us several personal stories related to the Hardings time at the house. The guided tour lasted roughly 1 hour.  After viewing the house, we went back inside to view the main exhibits. We opted to watch a short documentary about President Hardings life and some of the trials and tribulations he faced during his time as President. There were multiple informational plaques out for display, many of them quite text heavy, that went into detail about Hardings upbringing and roots as the owner of a newspaper company in Marion. The plaques also talked about election day, and several of the policy’s Harding implemented while in office. The last section of the museum dealt with his death and some controversial issues that surrounded his presidency. There were multiple artifacts out for display in the museum, along with short video clips that related to President Harding's time in office.  Tip: I recommend spending 3 hours here if you truly want to see everything.|en|https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g50609-d103249-r989351848-Reviews-Warren_G_Harding_Presidential_Sites-Marion_Ohio.html?m=66827#review989351848|PartyTheNightAway|Solo travel|2024-07-31|
