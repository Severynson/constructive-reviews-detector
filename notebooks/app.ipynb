       "\"Do not waste your time coming here. They tend to be very skimpy when it comes to your food. I paid for two beef, cheese & rice burritos which the cook put about 5 pieces of rice in each burrito! I called to speak with the manager and he said it was a mistake (yeah right) and that he wouldn't charge me for rice on my next order! He should've been offering two new burritos, if that's the best you can do, I will not be back! Also, they limit you on the salsa to go, you only get one per burrito and it's only a teaspoon.  Terrible and cheap! Try other places that believe in giving you your money's worth.\""

The location is more towards the outskirts of Stockton and seems to bring in a lot of locals. The wine list has a few local wines from Lodi and a few others. The wait times could be improved, but overall a great place to dine.\n"
